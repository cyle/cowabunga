After all, the state/city (I don't remember which) just passed this law saying that it is illegal to smoke in public parks so now smokers don't even have the option of crossing the street...\\ My grad school, Simmons recently went smoke-free. All businesses went smoke free years ago in Boston and as Julie P. points out, public parks have too. 



There IS no appropriate place for it. None. Emerson ought to encourage and support (including financially) students in smoking-cessation. \\ So I agree that smoking is unhealthy.

But to achieve academic excellence, I feel we should work to include diversity in more categories:  class, certainly, abilities and age--but even further, in temperament, points of view, and perspectives. Looked at that way, the possibilities are infinite.\\ I'm not sure there is such a thing as ""diverse enough."" I think there are an infanate number of types of people from different walks if life and with different perspectives. Just like we are never done learning and growing, I believe we are never done working to surround ourselves with a diversity of people and perspectives.

If Emerson were a public institution, with a stronger public mission, a case could be made that we should encourage all T-riders to investigate Emerson opportunities. But unlike Harvard, we are not a center of tourist interest, and shouldn't try to become one.\\ I really like the idea of putting our brand on the city's public transport in this way. If Emerson is positioned to be an epicenter for the arts and theater, why not explore this? Imagine it - WERS piped in and our student and faculty work on display, public displays of our community partnerships. I think it could be a really great way to show our commitment to the community. \\ Before Emerson can think about putting its name at the Boylston T stop, the stop itself has to stop ots brutal clash with Emerson's values.  First, the station would need to be made accessible to people who have difficulty with stairs..  Second, the ear-splitting decibel level of noise emanating from the tracks would have to be fixed.  The noise goes against the values of our CSD program because that level is, quite literally, deafening. 



In sum, I wouldn't vote to put Emerson's brand anywhere near that station.\\ In addition to bringing the station up to code, we'd need to find a donor with deep pockets.  The MBTA's initial asking price for naming stations was 7 figures.  Thankfully, no one bit"
10568,,What are some of the ways that the college is dealing with the issue of rape on the campus? I'm concerned about this because I just recently saw an article on Huffington Post. What can we do prevent issues like this from defining the school?,"Weird coincidence that Pelton sent out an email regarding that HuffPost article 7 minutes after this was posted.\\ The Huffington headline and photo was so bizarre.  Someone showed it to me on their phone in a restaurant.  Embarrassing, and totally irresponsible of HuffPost to present the content that way.  Would make an interesting case study of digital ""news"" reporting.\\ In words better than I can personally articulate:



""Dear President Pelton,

In light of your recent e-mail about the rape-related lawsuit against Emerson College, I want to take the opportunity to share my thoughts. I do so not just as an Emerson alumnus, but as a feminist and, frankly, a fellow human being.

Firstly, I think its wonderful that, as you shared, Emerson has taken steps toward establishing a Center of Violence Prevention and Response, as well as other educational and preventative measures to combat rape and rape culture.

However, it should go without saying that actions speak louder than words. Its one thing to talk about rape education in the hypothetical. Its another thing to properly assist an actual rape victim in the real world. As I understand it, in regards to the latter, Emerson College has fallen terribly short...\\ ...Emerson College is not being sued because a student was raped on campus. Emerson College is being sued because of the way it dealt with a students rape on campus. Of course Emerson is not at fault for the physical rape. That blame does, in fact, lie with the assailant. But Emerson is absolutely responsible for the way it handles rape allegations.

First and foremost, if the school wants to claim that it is not responsible for its actions in these regards, then it should not be dealing with these investigations in-house. If Emerson is not responsible for the way it handles rape, then rape cases should be forwarded to the police immediately. No questions asked...\\ ...For all the talk about faculty rape education at Emerson College, the target has been completely missed in practice. During the investigation, the rape survivor was forced to testify in the same room as her assailant. Leniencies of doubt were given to the assailant, but used against the victim. Worst of all, the victims possible inebriation was brought up as a means of victim blaming in order to question the veracity of her claims. Anyone actually educated in rape awareness knows that it doesnt matter whether or not the victim/assailant was drunk.To compare the schools inability to prevent rape to an inability to prevent drinking on campus is, frankly, disgusting, and shows a lack of both understanding and empathy on the part of Emerson College. Legal document or otherwise, the suggestion that the students prior consensual sexual encounter with the assailant somehow matters in the case of rape is also absurd. Rape is rape. No means no...\\ ...A husband can rape his wife and vise versa. Prior consent does not equal consent, and in the case of rape, prior consent should not ever be brought up. Its not applicable to the case at hand.

When it comes to the way Emerson has dealt with rape, not in the academic theoretical, but in actuality with real victims of rape, I ask this question: Would you let your daughter attend Emerson, knowing that if she was raped, the school would deal with it in such a manner? For me, the answer is a resounding NO. I would not want my daughter to attend Emerson. I would not want my friends to attend Emerson. And if Emerson College does not take responsibility for the horrid manner in which it has dealt with student rape on campus, I promise that I will encourage future potential students not to attend Emerson...\\ ...President Pelton, you claim that Emerson considers itself a national leader for campus efforts to end sexual assault. If this is truly the case, Im saddened and shocked that this is the best our nation has to offer.

Nobody is asking Emerson to stop rape from happening before it happens. Were simply asking that Emerson deals with rape properly, fairly, and most importantly, compassionately, when it does.

Im not proud right now to be an Emerson alum. Emersons response to rape has permanently tainted the way I view my alma mater. I am, however, proud to see so many Emersonians speaking out against the actions of their school. I can only hope that, in this case, the faculty can learn something from its students.



Best,

Dan (Stark)""\\ Ok, I know this question is not considered enlightened or politically correct, yet I will continue to ask this till I get a sensible answer:  why are colleges exempt from involving police in campus sexual assault investigations?  Rape is a crime, and successful prosecution often depends on forensic evidence.  Our campus security force, wonderful as they are, aren't equipped to prosecute this kind of crime. \\ @Maureen. Any/every student is asked if they would like the BPD to be called. The student makes the choice. This is considered best practices because it actually gives all the power to decide what happens to the student who is victimized. 



And whether or not the victim asks for the police to be involved, the college--every college--must report any act of violence to the government. (The Cleary Act.)



@Hsiao-yen I'm angry too about how things have been handled. There are people on this campus who are and have been for the past year working tirelessly and passionately to change policies, procedures, and campus climate. Many, many policies and procedures have now changed. Now we need to change the campus climate.

10231,Some but not all,Being an international student one of my take aways from emerson was being a better collaborator and I gained valuable skills in group works. However in the global scheme of things I think emerson students still lack a lot of skills. Eventhough they are open to different cultures they still communicate in the same way as they would to their own culture. What im getting at is that i dont think there is much emphasis on emersons curriculum in being global. Only time i had some information about cross culture communications was in Roxanna Moriescu's class. ,"There should be a cross cultural communication class, maybe a major."
10231,in my opinion there isnt enough emphasis on technologies in emerson it would definitely be good to see if emerson could find a way to start a major which would make the owners of the degree essentially bridges between technologies and consumers,,

How as a school of innovators can we innovate and create new things out of old mentalities. I just think it's a misnomer to be calling this a school of innovation but we still lag far behind other institutions in terms of the types of dialogue that's fostered on campus. It's not on the minds of people at this school. That's fine, but living in a bubble that's not representative of the world around us has a profound impact.

I was really sick yesterday and didn't have the strength to walk from Paramount (where I live) to the USB, let alone go to a doctor....it seems extreme. I understand the reasoning behind it but at the end of the day, as students we should be treated like adults. Just because some students lie about being sick and don't come to class shouldn't mean that students who are actually sick should have to go to great lengths in order to get their absence excused. We are paying for our education and if we decide not to come to class that's our prerogative. That being said, I have extremely good attendance (I only missed one class all last year, and yesterday's absences were my first this year) and I am a good student who comes to class on time, does the work,and participates. I shouldn't be penalized for being sick.","Is this actually a policy??? It seems very unreasonable to expect someone who is sick to drag themselves out to get a doctor's note! Seems like another example of the trend to over-supervise students' lives.\\ You should be treated like adults. We get sick days if were out sick and unless we are out for an extended length of time we don't have to get a doctors note. Why should you? You're also paying to be here. It's should be your prerogative to attend or not attend classes. The only person getting hurt is you if you miss something. Money up in smoke!\\ I agree you shouldn't be treated like children. However, I believe the reason for this policy is to insure sick people see a doctor/med professional - which in the current Ebola age, is a smart thing to do. Because so many of our students are venturing into adulthood for the first time, the college is trying to provide guidance to make the transition easier. Sickness may not mean Ebola, but might mean a regular issue with hangovers, or a sign of more serious problems. 



If you're feeling unfairly penalized, please speak with a dean. "

Without the time and space to think, reflect, dream . . . nothing creative happens, just a lot of display and design.  Beautiful and appealing, but not substantial.\\ I also agree! I think far too often we are so determined to finish a project and start the next that we tend not to spend as much attention and time on the process or reflect on the experience. We are so results oriented and that is a tough cycle to break! Granted, the work is always great.

Fully 3/4 of the world's population has no exposure to Emerson. Of those that have any, more than half would consider us to be related to noted American Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson. 



Of the very small portion of the 8 billion people on earth who have any specific idea what and where Emerson College is, it is the where that matters most, the what that matters next, and the exclusivity that matters after that. 



Emerson has opportunities, particularly with its foreign programs, to increase its global presence, but this means active and well managed community relationship maintenance in every site we set up shop. It means hiring locals and assisting them in increasing their own potential, and advocating for their rights and development in our partnering nations and communities. It means keeping Boston informed of these relationships and efforts, so that when we travel, we behave beter than the average American tourist, and can check in and get assistance from those in other places. 



Emerson is capable of being a leader. But leadership means sticking your neck out, which Emerson is often reluctant to do without a fairly reliable promise of success. ",,

When students can take in new and unexpected information, balance it against their intentions, and find a means to make them work together - I know they are likely to find Emerson a platform for greater success.

Emerson is more focused on helping its students achieve than in addressing issues of hunger or poverty or civil war or terrorism. It would be nice to care about such things, but due to our limited impact on the world, and limited time and resources, we are constrained. I know Lee has worked to make things happen here, but his initiative is not enough. (I've earlier mentioned http://gunviolence.emerson.edu/ seems to be more taking up space than taking anything on at the moment.) 



How could Emerson help? The best thing that might be feasible, it seems to me, is the creation of some dedicated think-tanks, with which faculty or courses could partner and produce white-papers and dedicated studies centering on issues. We've relied for years on Harvard's Berkman Center, but we ought to be stating what communication means in the digital era, what intellectual property rights and ramifications could and should be, how significant things like Net Neutrality are for individuals, corporations, and nonprofits. We could and should be active in illuminating the stages of Boston, but also in assessing them and reviewing them. The skills our students need to succeed must be our primary focus, but accomplishing things with them ought to rank more highly. Other than the CommDisorders treatment center and the polling society, it is rare to see students, faculty, and staff engaged with producing or effecting change more than incrementally and in piecemeal fashion. 



I don't believe a Day of Service each semester would do much to fix anything. I do think when profs are given the discretion to follow their passions, things can happen. However, Proyecto Medellin would likely fall apart should Tamera Marko be appointed to a more-deserved position elsewhere, and in spite of the extracurricular groups continued pushing, efforts fitting change in during a few spare minutes is a drop in the ocean.

Innovation within a community ought to mean more participation in community events - organizing representation in places of importance, as well as places of general opportunity. the Dragon-boat team is probably the best example of this. 



Emerson has little trouble proposing new ideas, though one could argue how sound some of those ideas are. What Emerson lacks is follow-through. The president's gun-violence initiative/letter-to-Obama was good for headlines, but had little legislative or therapeutic or long-term beneficial effect. 



I can speculate as to why innovation fails to find a foothold here: students, faculty, and staff are stretched too thin, don't have adequate space or time to operate effectively, and cannot get beyond their professional commitments to devote the necessary thought and energy to anything else. Have you seen the people who get tenure? They are burned out. And have you seen everyone else? They're on the verge of burnout and juggling more commitments than they can possibly meet.

The college can't support students in LA if they have mediocre resources there. One of the truest things I've found about large organizations is that you need to spend money to make money, and with more money you can take more risks.

Still, not having the option seems a serious flaw in the ""game"" to me. \\ From what I understand, anyone in the community is allowed to access this data and do their own analysis. \\ I hope this is true - that would be a benefit. But I'm still pretty sure you cannot access responses prior to submitting a response. Maybe I'm missing something obvious? \\ I think you are correct about that detail, but I'm just not sure that it stifles creativity as much as you are concerned that it does. The benefit of asking you to answer without seeing others' responses, as I understand it, is that your response won't be influenced by the responses of others. This helps avoid ""crowd think."""

I don't understand a lot about IT, though, so this isn't a new feeling for me. ","Grr, not comments, Causes. Hey game developers, I know I am not the only one frustrated by the inability to edit comments. Any chance you can add an edit function? \\ I believe the money would be used to hire students to do the work, giving them experience they may not otherwise have.\\ Thanks Tom. With the minimum wage increase in January, $1000 = 111 hours of student time .Assuming your w/s students get the same 20 hour maximum ours do, that's 5 weeks worth of pay for 1 student. I remain dubious - but capable of being impressed. \\ Dan, are you saying $1000 is too much or too little?\\ Well, Jenn, to make all of the college's data accessible via API's ,I suspect it's too little. But for a preliminary project to make 1-2 data-sourcess accessible for automated processing, it strikes me as too much.



So both? Or maybe it's a perfect 5-week project? Or because it's external funding, do we get around the work-study hire requirement, and/or the minimum wage laws? 



I basically want more details on the scope and specific plans for the $. \\ Unless they use the $1000 to fix ECWireless they are just a scam as far as I am concerned!\\ Dan, I talked to Cyle, who would likely be building them/overseeing the student workers - he says to email him and he'll share his approximations. 



Jake, if you're having wireless trouble, please call the helpdesk at (617) 824-8080, tweet @EmersonIT, use the form on http://it.emerson.edu, or walk into Walker 404. They'll want to know where and when you're having trouble, what device you're using, what kinds of things you're trying to do, etc. The more info you can provide, the more likely they can solve your problem. \\ Thanks Jenn, I don't mean to make more work for Cyle before he's rec'd any funds - but I thought more detail would be useful in the project description. I'll send Cyle an email as he devotes more and more of his coin accumulation to the project. \\ Dan, There'd be a lot more student hours if the student has a federal work study grant - then the college would only pay 25% of the salary. But, that limits who gets the opportunity.\\ So that $1000 would pay for 05 twenty-hour weeks, but the gov't. would pay for an additional 15 20-hour weeks? That makes much more sense. We'd get 400 person-hours for a $1000 investment? What a deal! "

Here are some of my favorites!



FOOD! I am a shameless foodie.. sorry, DH.. you just really don't cut it for me. I actually just spend my money on food and theatre tickets, so I guess that's not terrible. Restaurants in Boston that I love are:



Irashai- for sushi (salmon avocado ftw!) and incredibly inexpensive chicken katsu with the most delicious Asian veggies I've ever had.

Tantric- for Indian food and the $12 all you can eat lunch buffet- check this out if you're looking for a fun, high quality, and inexpensive lunch.

Blackjack Pasta- make your own pasta and they have *FREE* delivery until midnight! You choose what kind of pasta you want, which sauce, and then choose from over 35 different mix ins and toppings. I liked to order BJP with my roommates last year.

Bova's Bakery- for Italian pastries and desserts in the North End. Go with your friends at 2 AM, it's open 24/7!

Forum- My brother's favorite restaurant in Boston.. they have sophisticated comfort food like chicken noodle soup, brick chicken, and steak and cheese egg rolls. This one's a little more expensive. Wait until your parents come to town for this one.

Papa Razzi- another great Italian place. I go here with my mom when she comes to visit. Get the gnocchi! It's amazing :3



THEATRE! If you're a theatre major in Boston, like me, it's ridiculous to not take advantage of all of the amazing opportunities to see free/cheap theatre. The Boston theatres that show touring productions (Colonial Theatre, Opera House) have student rush tickets for $25. It's an easy way to see professional shows. Other companies like ArtsEmerson have $10 tickets for students, and regional theatres like the Lyric Stage and Speakeasy also offer inexpensive student tickets. I saw Sweeney Todd at the Lyric for $10 once. Because of these cheap tickets, I am able to see a show or two every week. It's really a great opportunity that I wouldn't have any other way.

Emerson is amazing because not only is Boston a college town (I believe 3/5 people in Boston are students, during the academic year), it IS that thriving and vibrant community you know it to be. And as a film major, Emerson is a wonderful place. Apply to live on the Film Immersion floor and you will get professional opportunities to film many awesome things. My friends won a contest where they filmed pro BMX biker Thomas Oelher, and they got to film the Red Bull DJ'ing Party. It was a great opportunity to make connections and work in the field.

9730,"Maria, my love! Here, come sit with me. Let me buy you a tea and tell you like it is. Here are my top five tips for succeeding at Emerson your freshman year.



5) Get involved. There are SO many groups on campus that can fulfill any of your extracurricular needs. Like to write? Try Emertainment Monthly or ISIS Magazine. Not a theatre major, but looking to step into the spotlight? The four major theatre orgs on campus allow every student the opportunity to participate in live theatre both on and offstage. Feeling sporty? Join Emerson's Quidditch team, a popular Harry Potter inspired sport that actually goes to championship levels! There are tons of opportunities for you, and not only will you learn new skills, but you'll also make friends and connections that will last a lifetime.



4) Find time to study. Emersonians are very engaged in their craft, regardless of what it is, but don't let that deter from your time to complete your homework and other class assignments. The cool thing is that professors are usually in tune to the fact that we are all artists, and will probably let you tailor the assignment to fit something you're interested in. I got an A+ on a Pop Culture essay last year because I asked my teacher to let me tailor the topic to feminism in French New Wave movies. Never be afraid to approach a professor for help, and know that you can always talk to them at their office hours or via email.



3) Keep yourself open to friends and people in general. I feel like during freshman year, it's easy to fall into two categories. There's the people who want to be friends with EVERYONE and overexert themselves to the point where they're just not making meaningful relationships, and there's the people who don't ever want to leave their rooms and refuse to make friends of any kind. The people you meet during orientation week might not be the BFFs you thought they would be. You might not get along well with your roommate. Some days, you might feel like no one wants to be friends with you.. and hey, that's all okay. But keep yourself open. Emerson is a great place because people are so passionate about what they do. Find people who share your passions and seek friendships with them. You'll be better off with a few good friends that way.



2) Make time for YOU. Emerson, though it is wonderful, can be a stressful place. We are living in a glorified artist's commune, and tempers can run high when you have lots of creative people together in a small space. It's okay not to go out every night. It's okay to stay in and watch Netflix and order takeout. Do something each day that makes you happy. Whether it's going for a walk in the Public Garden, or buying yourself a tea latte at Starbucks, do one thing a day for yourself. You will be so much happier that way.



1) Enjoy Emerson. Enjoy Boston. Take in all that it has to offer. Four years go by SO fast. I know, I'm almost halfway through sophomore year. Just let yourself enjoy the ride. I promise, it's a good one.

Most of the clubs I am a part of gather here.

The only issue is how uncomfortably small the lounge is at the Max. If a bunch on on-campus kids want to hang out there, obviously nobody can stop them, but if they are there using all the electrical jacks, sitting in all the seats, and taking up all the space--it kind of leaves me nowhere to go, and that's my only beef with it. Since they all have their own dorms to sit in, that makes me a little angry, because if I need to charge my computer or sit down during the day it is the only place I can go other than our way-too-crowded library.

I was thinking about a lot of the different things I could do to help the off-campus community at Emerson College. Since I came to Emerson last year as a sophomore and lived off-campus now for both of my years at Emerson, I have been tossing around ideas in my head about what might be done to improve the quality of commuting/off-campus life for students like myself at school. One of the things Community Plan-it has been asking us repeatedly is what areas at school we feel most welcome, and which we don't. I have realized from these prompts that aside from the one area at the Campus Center and the library (if there are ever any seats), there is really nowhere for commuters to go during the day that isn't also swamped with dorm students who very well could be in their rooms; instead they are hogging (cont.)",
9812,,"the precious wall chargers and taking up the seats from people who have been riding trains and lugging books all day. I understand they are students too, and would never discriminate, but one of the things I would want to donate my points for on Community Plan-it would be an off-campus student union of sorts--maybe a group of people who could organize and vouch for areas on campus specifically for off-campus kids to take a load off and feel welcome. I have never felt more disconnected from Emerson than when the woman swiping cards at the dining hall told me I couldn't eat my bagged lunch there, and since the library was closed I had to sit outside or in some random store to eat my lunch. I felt so cast out. I think if the off-campus students could have their own lounge with a dining area, maybe it would make a lot of people's lives easier who could finally have a voice that were to afraid to speak up. What do you think? I wholly back this idea if others are in the same boat.","I agree that a space for off-campus students would be great, but one of Emerson's biggest problems in general is just ... lack of space. Lack of rehearsal space, performance space, study space, lounging space, it all falls under that umbrella, unfortunately.\\ Yeah, this is also true. But, still, it is worth a shot to maybe just expand one area, since the faculty are pledging to have their own faculty space as well (I thought that there was a grad student/professor lounge the faculty used in Ansin?) maybe what Emerson needs to do is acquire a new building overall. That would be fantastic. We have a really ambitious community that needs more space. But $1,000 couldn't really do that for us right now anyways...hopefully in the future."
9812,,"I don't know where to post this or how to link it to the therapy dog cause, but isn't $1,000 a little steep to have simply have dogs come visit the school? I'm not against it, and plan to donate my coins to it, but I'm just hoping this is not something that is spent frivolously and will actually buy more than lint rollers and advertising that the event described. I've advertised for my own services on campus before for literally $2.50 in printing and online ads. It just seems a little ridiculous to throw $1,000 towards therapy dog 'lint rollers and advertising.' Couldn't that be expanding upon more? Why not go the extra mile and make it 'Relaxation Week' with therapy dogs. My last school did that and it was great...free food, I think we stuffed some bears or something, and we fundraised as well. Why not make this into something bigger and make sure the money goes where it can help relax students besides trivial details? (Dollar Store lint rollers are a thing!) I like the idea. ","Christina,

You have a good point, and the group that's been planning for the Therapy Dogs has been planning complimentary activities to support it which would use the money.  We've been thinking of calling it a ""Cirque de De-stress"" to emphasize its variety. For example, we plan to have sites for students/staff/faculty to de-stress in other ways, such as an arts & crafts area, the WARC tutors who can do short reviews of writing, ECAPS staff doing relaxation activities, and possibly a massage therapist for the students' hands, shoulders, etc.  



We have received additional support from a couple of offices due to our visibility in this game, so what we're planning has been broadening as a result.  And yes, we hope that this can happen at least once a semester going forward (after all, Harvard has dogs in weekly)-- with the dogs and other ways to support students towards relaxation, both in the moment & for acquiring tools for ongoing de-stressing. \\ Hi Christina,



The $1000 would not be spent on lint rollers and face masks, but is insurance in case there's unforeseen damage to college property. Assuming we do not need to spend $ on repairs and clean-up, we will have the funds to do it again the following semester (if the first semester is successful.) 



Due to the nature of events, more money needs to be in reserve than is spent on events. But unspent money will be used as a springboard to future success. \\ Additionally, Paws for People is a non-profit organization and volunteers do this work of their own volition. It would be nice if Emerson could turn around and make a donation to this group.\\ Thanks for the clarification! Like I said, I'm backing this idea with all my coins anyways, I was just worried based off the description that the money would be distributed in a funny way...but seeing now that this will indeed be a long term thing and include insurance makes much more sense. We are a mass of stressed out students and I think this would benefit everybody, glad it's turning out popular.\\ And perhaps most importantly, without making this a Cause, we would not be receiving the visibility we have been needing to gain approval from top admins.  



Committed staff have been advocating for Therapy Dogs for three (3) years (!) already, and it's not until this public forum and students/staff/faculty combining to voice support that we've made significant progress to realizing the goal. 

Woof!"

- Technological resources of all types are available to students, from a robust wireless network to computer labs open 14 hours a day. Laptops, video cameras, iPads - any sort of device you could possibly desire is borrowable from one of our many distribution centers. The Student Technology Guide on it.emerson.edu offers a comprehensive look for all students of what is available at Emerson



- The administrative support structure is unparalleled - counseling of personal, academic, or professional natures are available from Counseling and Psychological Services, Academic Advising, and Career Services respectively. For those both unfamiliar with the collegiate environment or eager to succeed to the fullest possible extent, these resources are invaluable.



- The personal resources available to Maria are everywhere - her fellow students, her advisor and her professors can provide a support structure for a student just starting out. As she grows during her time here, she will find even more resources - peers in extra curriculars, in service groups, at on-campus jobs - all of whom can make Emerson feel a little bit more like home.

9895,"Emerson should strive to be part of the base of a student's life. The final piece that a student can then start building upwards. With a shaky base, a pyramid cannot get very high - nor can a student go very far. This doesn't necessarily mean just the education provided - it means the overall experience. Students should be in a diverse and engaged community. There also should be a focus on improving financial aid with the rising cost of college. Ideally, cost nor the prospect of student debt, should never hamper a person's education. And college should never be a barrier to a student's future - it should never get in the way of greatness.

There is also a great social awareness in general at Emerson - students talking about uncomfortable and hot-button issues openly. As for the school itself - there are always open discussions and panels going on. I'd like to see more action taken - whether that's students volunteering to go somewhere and help out, or staff being able to engage in more community volunteer days. There is an awareness of what's going on, but sometimes I do worry that Emerson feels that's sufficient. To know, but not to act. I'm not saying Emerson needs to contribute in some major way - but there could be more than what we are already doing. ",,

9895,"Emerson, now, more than ever - has cemented itself as a unique institution that offers it's students a broad experience from engaging in critical thinking to honing hands on skills. The focus of Emerson on it's students and the push to give them the best education possible is so palpable - and it keeps getting stronger. I can only see Emerson's reputation increasing as the years pass - as long as the current momentum is kept up. However, I think this is the wrong question. I don't think Emerson should be focusing on what the degree means - I think they should be focusing on what it takes to get to the degree, and who these kids are who are getting the degrees. That's really where Emerson can effect where it's going in the future. It's a good goal and an admirable goal - that degree - but the degree should never overshadow the journey. Really what Emerson should focus on is getting more students in here who may never have thought they could go to Emerson because of financial constraints or background, as well as continuing to hire world-class faculty who will push these students. As long as the students are challenged and have to work hard and are engaged - those degrees will speak for themselves. ",,

9895,"Has thinking gone out of style yet? Is being a well-read and intelligent individual suddenly obsolete? Are future employers only interested in someone who spends all their times in one tiny microcosm of the human existence? I think not. Philosophy is one part of a greater education that introduces undergrads to thinkers and books they may have never encountered before. What happens if he has to make a movie one day about Nietzche and casts a non-mustachioed actor in the lead role? How's that going to look? Philosophy is an amazing and intricate subject matter that can only improve upon your mind. If you zero in on just film, you are hurting yourself. It's like those guys who go to the gym and just do arms. Huge biceps - skinny little legs - you're totally off balance dude! No one is into the skinny legged-giant-armed man. Just like no future employer is interested in someone who doesn't get outside their comfort zone. You cannot be a fully creative adult if you don't dabble in different things and yes, read impossibly hard books and try to wrap our brain around the a priori judgements, and Descartes cogito ergo sum - never mind delving into Plato's notes! Philosophy is about more than just really hard reading and big words. It's also about guys with weird last names. No, joking. It's about learning how the human mind has evolved, how thought has evolved, and how rationality came to be.

What exactly are these skills we need for this global world vs the other world people assume Emersonians are living in? I think instead of making it sound fancy and futuristic, and a tad unattainable, Emerson should focus on helping hone the skill sets that have always been in style. Courtesy, active listening, empathy, open-mindendess, excellent communication... these are not ""new"" skills we are just learning when we get to Emerson. We've been working on these skills our entire lives and always will be. Emerson should focus on pushing those skills to become even more engrained - before the students leave and enter the real world. Honestly what a great college should do is illuminate where students' weaknesses are - whether communication, timeliness, or working under pressure - and help the students work on and strengthen them!",

But that, unfortunately is the demand of the world around these students - a multi-faceted individual with creative ideas and hands-on-knowledge. I could see these kinds of majors becoming more along the lines of longer programs with internships built in and the push for graduate school degrees in a concentration of what the undergrad was.

9895,"While technology can advance teaching and offer wonderful, lightning fast tools that help students and faculty alike - at the end of the day there is no substitute for great teachers and hard working students. It doesn't matter the tool - across the historical gamut of education - it has always been the conversation and the Socratic method that has lasted and has made a lasting impact. I do think that there may be more of a blended classroom in 2025 - the lectures are online, while class time is spent engaging and conversing. Of course there will always been hiccups and glitches - that's just the way it goes. But there will be an expectation for faculty to know these tools well, and the students will always be pushing the tools. In a weird way, I think technology will lose it's glamor a bit and certain tools will become naturally part of the class, and others will fall off as unnecessary. I do also think that certain skill-sets will become more common - basic HTML and CSS, and basic CMS administration.

9895,Something else entirely,"Emerson wears many different hats. A scally cap, a feathered hat, a top hat, a bonnet, a fedora... It's one of the most unique schools I have ever encountered. Since I took classes at a variety of colleges around Massachusetts, I can safely say there are none even remotely close to what Emerson offers. It felt often like a trade school mixed with liberal arts. One minute your hands on with a camera in class, the next you are sitting down to a lecture about ethics. There is an energy here like nothing else. Something is always moving forward - there is a momentum that is easy to get caught up in. And the faculty are amazing. I loved all of my professors here - they were intelligent, fun, and pushed their students to be their absolute best. ","Well said Paula.

One example I can think of were those wonderful t-shirts that two students created right at Emerson to raise awareness and money for the Boston Marathon victims. That was a truly beautiful and socially spirited thing to do for a distraught city. And they might not know it - but that shirt did make it's way out into the towns and cities outside of Boston.

The Jimmy Fund is a staple of the Boston community, and has been for a long time.

Big Brother, Big Sister offers varied opportunities for volunteering individually or in groups, or pulling in the entire Emerson community. 



BACH hits home the hardest - it's out there, working for the good of Boston and the health of its residents.

9895,"Innovation is a tricky word. Does it necessarily mean ""new"" and ""flashy""? Or does it mean assessing and implementing meaningful change that can positively effect both Emerson and the communities that are around it? I think, and hope, it means the latter. While I might not have any ideas of exactly what that can mean, I believe that the most poignant ideas are the ones that are not self-centered or self-serving. Rather they are the ideas that are bigger than themselves, that catch people's attention and inspire them to act. 

At Emerson, I am not sure I could point to a crystal clear example - but rather that there are tiny sprouts of it all around - little flashes of potential that are slowly dictating where the college is going. We are trying to be more connected as a community - after all you are reading this right now, aren't you? :) We are seeking ways to stay committed to diversity and inclusion. There are pillars that we can refer to to try to shape these ideas around. We are trying to get classes online. We are participating in community events - some us planted flowers on the common! And there are committees and groups discussing these issues and trying to come up with ideas. 

It might slow and painful sometimes, and the change might seem small - but that's part of the fun. It's the journey, after all, that is usually a little bit more memorable than the destination. ",,Well put Paula!\\ Well said!!!\\ Preach!

First, Emerson has amazing student discounts at different museums - including the MFA, which was a second home to me as a student (since it was FREE ADMISSION.)

The T, although cranky and slow, can bring you to a slew of different neighborhoods with a million different things to offer. And finally, my favorite thing, which is my prejudice as a Massachusetts girl born and bred - the SPORTS! What a city to love sports in or to learn to love sports in. The Bruins, the Celtics (although they are pretty terrible in recent years,) and the ever up and down Red Sox. Everyone should go to a game at Fenway and the Garden. They are magical, historical places where you can taste the culture - see the generations of families brought together by a common passion ingrained in the very roots of the city. Even if you don't share in it, or understand it, you should witness it and let the exhilaration of a Patrice Bergeron goal wash over you, and try to see Papi glaring down a pitcher. Share in this world - this strange, R-less world of these crazy Massachusetts people. I even say get out of Boston - go wander down the Cape, go see P-Town, and even get up on the North Shore - Rockport, Gloucester, Salem!

Providing robust opportunities and encouragement for students to pursue service opportunities on their own may be more fruitful, particularly if classroom learning and the whole ethos of the school fosters real thinking about self in relation to community/the wider world. The prompt here is tricky, because setting up the idea of service/learning as just benefiting the community/org without talking about the benefit/impact on the participant is incomplete.

It's like that.""\\ for the most part it means access to data. Data that may not necessarily be exposed in the apps. Such as, who exactly ""liked"" your comment. The most obvious application of having access to data is drawing your own conclusions about what the data means. In the form of graphs for example. makes sense?\\ As has been said, an API is simply a standard, reliable way to access raw data. Your web browser is a kind of API, but built for humans -- it has a URL/address bar where you ask for specific info, and it's returned in a human-readable format (a webpage). An API usually returns information in a computer-readable format instead of a human-readable format.\\ To piggyback on Cylebot's reponse, an API allows different programs to talk to each other.

There are so many classes you've likely taken within your major, and they won't always transfer. That means wasted time, money, and energy. In that case, I'd recommend to Joanne to stay the course; you can go anywhere with almost any kind of degree as long as you're dedicated and can show off your talent. That being said, Emerson could best benefit by making the program change process more transparent. Additionally, it would help if major credits - save for those in the most technical of courses - had some sort of transfer potential besides as electives. There has to be some crossover with the curriculum and the lessons learned, and it would make switching easier if there were a way to pick out the similarities. Logistically, that's difficult to do.

I can credit coming to Emerson with some of these experiences, but the reality is that they could have happened with or without the school. The fact is, people don't always grow up from stress, though many do. It's more about having examples to follow when going through adversity.

9671,"I know my first answer seems very harsh, in fact, I've been hopeless trying to find a way to rearrange it to sound more PC, nonetheless, the problem illustrated there by in large, addresses my major issue with this institution. 



I'm not going to reference any scandal that has happened recently because, in my eyes, while important for us to note, it serves no purpose than to drive home the overall point. 



We need a college where the administration and department heads don't seem so terrified and out of touch with the student body. One where students don't need five people's permissions and several dozen papers to sign in order to film in a common room in LB. We need a college that makes being a communicator easy, even if it's critical of the institution. 



There needs to be transparency when you can give it, no red tape where it isn't 100% necessary, and better yet, a community where faculty aren't hidden away in some random floor in the LB,but where a student can walk in and feel friendly enough to ask for a coffee with Mr.Ludman. 





And call me an idealist, or what you will, an Emerson where a student who desires to make something one day, can in fact do so before his semester is out, working both with the students at this college, and a faculty to back them up. As it stands, I think there is too much reliance on the college for students to teach other students the ropes and tricks of production, writing, what have you. I want to be educated by our faculty who have a curriculum  that is thoroughly planned and thought out. Where registration is an adventure like The Hobbit and not easily comparable to the Hunger Games. Where a college which desires to be considered global offers more than just French and Spanish.



 There is so much potential for this college to be a world class institution, but right now, I feel like we're going through some serious growing pains. And I say this, as an Emersonian who is as it stands right now wrapping up his educated,is unsure of how he feels about his time here. I still maintain to all my friends that I think Emerson College it in itself to shine as of the great college's of the northeast, but as it stands right now, we're not there yet, and the one thing holding these students, who by and large are the driving factors in this school, is the backwards behavior of our college's attitude towards us. 



So, to whoever is reading this, I guess this is the best I can give.

Just think, Jake will never leave!\\ My vision of Cabaret 2.0 is a space designed by students, managed by students, and featuring events by and for students.  Easiest way to describe it would be a corss between Space 57 at the Revere Hotel and the Hotung Cafe at Tufts - semi-blackbock theater that can be set up as social/lounge space when not in use for specific events, and that has a food service option (my choice would be a coffee/smoothie bar with light snacks) so that students, faculty and staff have another place to come together.  The space would be adaptable to accommodate the variety of events we host, dinners, concerts, comedy shows, theatrical performances, screenings, fashion shows, etc. and feature expanded options of many of the features we have now, such as live mixing for audio and lighting, and more.  It would be the premier space on campus for events."

Greek Life has done well to break out of this through Greek-wide efforts, but that still stops within our own little community. It sucks to say, but Emerson students are often so self-centered that if you don't do something related to someone else's interests, then you really don't interact.

Not sure if you have seen the Beacon article on a topic SGA discussed this week around the issue of smoking outside of campus buildings but this is an issue the college has been struggling with for a while! Does anyone have any creative or innovative ideas how to address this? How do we balance the needs of a smoker with the needs of a community member who wants to get to class or their office or walk the streets without passing through second hand smoke? 

http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/news/2014/10/1/smoking-outside-of-buildings-72","As a smoker (I know, for shame) I agree that the gaggle of smokers just outside the buildings is a problem.  However, where else will we go?!  At the Union Bank building (217 Tremont St) we go around the corner to the ally way where this is a parking lot and garage.  Are there places which can be designated at smoking areas which are not in front of buildings but are clearly marked and may even have ashtrays?  I think this would be helpful for all.  And yeah, I get it that designating a smoking area feels like, to the administration, they are condoning smoking, but unless and until smoking tobacco is made illegal (not my chosen option) it seems the best option.\\ Thanks Karen! I really appreciate your perspective and it is helpful to hear from smokers on this too! Is there a location that you would suggest? \\ Point taken about the alley between Maj and LB.  The alley next to 216 Tremont has a sidewalk (this is where smoke already) so that could be one.  Also, I notices on Tremont St, the LB side there is a cut out next to 201 Tremont which is NOT a doorway, could this be a place?  It is small, but I am trying to come up with some ideas."

Some members of SGA mentioned that email was the best way to reach them but that they get so many emails from various Emerson sources over the course of a day that they get overloaded and often get the same message from multiple sources - citing Emerson Uncommon as an example. They got an email about the game from News, from this week at Emerson, from their faculty, from their department, from my staff in my office, etc. My question is this - how do we streamline the delivery of information to provide the community with info about opportunities in a way that will actually be received? ","Separating the wheat from the chaff is a time-consuming task of adulthood. \\ It'd be great to have a college-wide internal communications coordination team. We've built up a pretty solid communications team within IT, and it's worked really well to unify our communications with the college. Maybe the entire campus could use one such team that helps streamline big email blasts. \\ I wonder about having some sort of opt-in listserv, where students (and staff) could choose which messages to recieve. For example, choosing to recieve all announcements from the Institue but no email about films.\\ That isn't a bad idea Cate, but then we assume that film students are only interested in film and missing out on other intrests and opportunitues to help expand their perspective. I really like Cyle's plan of coordinating and streamlining efforts. In theory, anyone can go to spacebook to see what is booked on campus by sponsoring department, group, location, time,  etc., but that takes work and I am not sure many do it. \\ Andy Tiedemann and Dan O'Brien recently helped ODI with this problem. We want to advertise our events and newsletter to the Emerson community, but don't want to oversaturate everyone's email box. I think they'd love to know about your feedback!"

4275,,"Just throwing this out there... I wish Emerson had better heat and air conditioning management. If anything I wish it was at least consistent? I started my day freezing cold in the dorms, proceeded to visit a classroom with a decent temperature that would blast freezing cold air every ten minutes, and finished the day in a scorching hot classroom to the point where the entire class was melting and it seriously impacted our lesson on both the professor and the students' ends. And this has been a problem for the entire three years I've been at Emerson. Is there any way to make this at least even a little bit better?","I'm always cold in the library.  and since I work here, I'm always cold.\\ It might be freezing on one floor in Tufte, but it's hot and stale on the second floor. I know there's one HVAC person for all of campus.  That seems ridiculous. \\ I'm glad I'm not insane and this is an actual thing other people feel. You can definitely experience a hundred different temperatures in one day in the Ansin building. And I'd like no more air conditioning in October, please! 57 degrees and rainy doesn't constitute the AC for me at least.\\ I agree, however, as these buildings are old and retrofitted, it is difficult to get the air to be consistent.  I have been working in old buildings like this and it is always a problem.  Not a solution, but at least and answer,



My office bounces between too hot and too cold!\\ I want to give a shout out to Emerson's HVAC guy.  He is indeed one of the busiest guys on our facilities team, which includes a great bunch of hardworking, service oriented and friendly men and women.  Busy as he is, he always takes time to answer my questions about specific HVAC issues. And even if Emerson had completely modern and fully efficient HVAC systems, there would still be people who thought it was too hot or too cold because different people have different comfort levels.  This is New England, people.  Celebrate the diversity of our seasons.  Bring a sweater to work or dress in layers so that you can adjust to changing temperatures, indoors and out.\\ Sure everybody feels temperature differently and sure layers can sometimes fix temperature issues, but what about when Emerson turns off the heat when it's freezing cold, and turns off the air conditioning when it's extremely hot? I usually wouldn't mind, but for the past 3 years there have been days I haven't been able to use my room because it was too hot to function and there was nothing I could do about it because I had no control over the air conditioning. Is this to save money or does it just decide not to work for months at a time? Shout out to the HVAC guy, I'm sure he works extremely hard, but it'd be nice if for once I could have control over the temperature of my room. I can't even open my windows to try and counteract anything because for the last 2 years I've had broken windows that won't stay open. Remind me what my room and board is paying for again?



I'm sorry if this is rude, I really don't mean to be, but I'm tired of being told to just ""deal with it"" all the time.\\ I hear your pain but what some of the others have said is true and believe it or not, we recently had some upgrades to the actual systems which have made things better (I know, it still doesn't make you feel better).  One of the other problems is that in buildings like Ansin and Walker offices and spaces change constantly but the duct work in those spaces does not change which causes problems.  For example, I need to keep my storage room within a certain temperature range (cooler) and the adjacent spaces a little warmer. I can tell when their is a problem right away when I walk in and the the hallway is hot. That means my storage area is hot and my office (adjacent to storage) is cold.  Makes no sense, I know but that's how it works.  Bottom line is not system is perfect in any building (Emerson or not) so I find that layers is the best option."
4275,,"I'd like to voice the concerns of not only myself but a lot of Animation majors when I say that the Animation and Motion Media part of the VMA department has also been getting lost. Being in a department that focuses so much on the film side has left us working extra hard to make the most out of our experience here. Not only are there only a few animation specific classes that are actually part of the major, but it's also extremely difficult to get into them. There were only 3 spots available for a required class that happens once a year. So not only are animation majors not always able to take their classes, but the classes offered are extremely general. It'd be nice to have classes dedicated to just modeling or just texturing instead of two classes that try to cover absolutely everything in a really short amount of time. The professors work extremely hard to help us make the most out of what's offered, but it'd be nice if there was somehow a way to improve upon this situation.","I think there is a large disconnect between several of the specializations in VMA. Post Production is in the same boat with only 2 editing classes. Due to the setup of the 200, 300, 400 level classes, I even completed the Animation track before I completed my own Post Production track.  It baffles my mind that I'm supposed to soak up everything about editing in 2 classes while if I were a Film Production student, I would be able to take several different production classes & choose between different directions. Show everyone some more love!



Maybe some compositing or color correction classes?\\ The same problem is apparent in the Audio Post-Production specialization, in that many of my friends who are Sound Design majors couldn't get into sound design classes because they were full with non major students.\\ Exactly! It doesn't make sense that we're supposed to specialize in something with only two or three classes? It's not nearly enough. And the non major students taking specialized classes is a huge problem throughout majors apparently.

""The study of philosophy has always been of serious interest to human beings. In addition, in any fieldfrom business, to medicine, to law, to teaching, to computer programming and civil engineeringthe ability to think clearly and creatively as well as the capacity to solve problems is central to professional success and personal satisfaction. Of course, while taking one or two philosophy classes does not guarantee success, a philosophy class is one of the best ways to work on the acquisition and development of:



    Critical thinking skills: The ability to identify key issues in decision-making or problem solving; and to identify various related problems and solutions.

    Skills in argumentation: The ability to proceed in a valid and sound way from premises to conclusions; to rationally persuade others; to more rigorously seek reasoned self-understanding.

    Communication skills: The ability to summarize the content of a message clearly and objectively (for example, to differentiate fact from value); to explain complex ideas and principles.

    Skills in design and planning: The ability to look at a problem, or an opportunity, from different angles and to identify alternative plans of action or design.""

I would bring alumni  and special guests with me as well. We have a shortage of community space on this campus. We should really make the most of what we have. There is nothing like face to face interaction over a meal.,"100% agree!  This would be a great thing to reinstate \\ I love this idea! I feel like I would get to interact with students and people outside my department more, if I could use the Dining Hall. It's a great, ready-made space for community building, as you say!\\ I agree....Let's move away from huddling at our desks with packed lunches all the time. \\ Totally with you on the lunch-at-the-desk thing.  It's nowhere!  



And, the dining hall,--it's great!  Not only would I like to see the staff and faculty have an opportunity for discounted lunches, but how about if there were tables designated for different things like topics of interest, or meet and greet, or learn about different departments/initiatives, or cultural chats,-- all very informal, inviting to students, staff, and faculty.  



Most of us do have to eat, after all, and the 

DH is a great space (never full at lunchtime) with a huge variety of food options-- we should take advantage of it as a primary spot for Emersonian de-siloizing!\\ It would be marvelous to be able to go to the DH and be all nostalgic at lunch time.\\ I would love this!  It's a natural way to build community, and so much better for you than gulping something down at your desk!\\ This kind of ties in with Kathryn R's suggestion for a faculty lounge area--the dining hall could be a good place to meet and chat.\\ This is a great idea!\\ I did not take advantage of that nearly enough when it was available. It would be nice to not have to pay out the nose for lunch. (also, ew that sounds gross)\\ Absolutely. It is so hard to find a moderately healthy meal around here for anything less than $10. Ain't nobody got [money] for that!\\ I'm into cheap meals with a place to sit and converse. Can't get better than that. But if not, here's a suggestion for cheap meals.

Because of her time at Emerson, she will be able to do this adequately and be the best candidate for the job. Her writing background applies in the same way.

So, no, we are not an art school, but we have amazing art programs and treat almost anything we do here as 'an art form' which is part of the reason why I came here for writing...because I have always felt that it was an artistic process and many other ""liberal arts"" colleges do not adhere to the ideology.

I think there must still be plenty of letters hidden here. Sometimes at night when I can't sleep I'll get up and check the nursery. I'll peel up a corner of carpet that looks loose; or tug on a warped baseboard. Less and less I'll take a book down from a shelf to have a pale pink leaf fall to the floor, but I know there are more. The one and only time I tried to garden I unearthed a metal toolbox rusted shut. When I'd pried the thing open a pile of rust-pink letters slid out. Each time I find another letter I file it with the rest in a series of boxes in the attic. I do my best to keep them in chronological order, but I can't bring myself to read them all.

It is not easy sharing art or a passion like that, opening yourself up to critics and strangers, and they traveled all the way from Colombia to open themselves up to us. Their stories and art were amazing. 



As an alum and current graduate student, my favorite learning moment is really more about all the things I've been able to do and experience while at Emerson. I tested the waters in several majors and disciplines, and when I came up against a wall, my Emerson education told me to find another way.

9601,Professional school,"Speaking from my experience with VMA.  Unfortunately, I feel like Emerson sometimes gives students the impression that it's an art school when in fact it's more like a Professional School.  Emerson is clearly very invested in the LA program, in Hollywood, and providing practical tools for students to start careers.  Students are constantly trying to pigeonhole themselves as ""producer,"" ""editor,"" and not thinking about their body of work, not considering what is at stake and larger incentives to make work than a career. 



 It's a hard balance because the skills Emerson provides are invaluable.  I think Emerson has the possibility to straddle between a school whose students make critical media art and a professional school  where students can get real world skills-  students are sponges, eager to learn and question, and the core of the professors teaching in the film dept. are amazing artists. But somewhere in there careers and internships in LA take over.

Other institutions in the area offer extremely discounted rates or even offer daycare within the institution itself.  Talk about building community - lessening this burden on families would have a tremendous impact on families in the Emerson community.  ,"If we had benefits for the Transportation Children's Center, that would be AMAZING. I gave up on Emerson-discounted daycare pretty darn fast.\\ What about adult day care?  I have no kids but I do have an aging parent.  We often talk about what we can do for families.  This lets out those of us who do not have families (I had one, but my husband died 2.5 years ago, we have no kids.) Aside from the tremendous financial burden of going from a two income household to a one income household is hard enough in this two income world, there is no one to help me with my mom when she gets sick.  Yet, there is little talk about adult day care and supporting SINGLE people trying to live in this very expensive city.\\ Karen, contact alayne_fiore@emerson.edu to find out when the next meeting of EmCares is. 



Originally there were going to be two groups called EmMoms and EmDads, but it became one called EmCares specifically so that it could also include people who are caring for older or disabled family members.



It meets about once a month over lunch and functions as a social support group and to decide if there is anything that we want to pursue with our newfound power as an officially recognized Employee Resource Group.\\ I used daycare in Chinatown through the BostonChinatown Neighborhood Center, and they charge rates on a sliding scale depending on your income.

"
9601,,"I'm a bit concerned about some of the causes that have been approved.  It's not that I'm not for, say a Faculty Lounge or switching the TV studios to HD, but it seems like those types of projects need way more than $1,000 and should probably just be investments made by the school.  Those causes should be priorities for the school and the school should be investing in making the change.  I strongly feel that these $1000.00 prizes should go to a place that: a) really can't be ""justified"" by any particular department b) where the funds can make a significant impact.  ","While I understand this, I really think that it is fair for people who feel strongly about something to put it out there.  Myself, therapy dogs for finals leaves me nonplussed (I worry about people who are allergic to dogs trying to share the space.) But is seems important especially to students, so who am I to judge?\\ Karen, we in the library share your concern. We're investigating whether we could provide face-masks so people whose allergies are affected by inhaling hair or dander could get some time with the dogs without suffering badly. (We can't provide drugs, I'm told.) We want this to be accessible to as many people who want to participate, and safe and comfortable for anyone who really doesn't. \\ I agree with Kim-- I don't think she's judging the merits of any of the initiatives suggested. I think she's suggesting that we players of the game should support causes that go beyond what would ostensibly be an extra thousand dollars to a department's budget. And that's not to suggest that those changes are unimportant-- actually the opposite. Rather than get $1000 in this platform, perhaps some of these causes would require (and deserve) more institutional support (as Kim noted, converted TV studios to HD is a great example of that). Just my opinion.\\ Exactly.  My comment is more about making a distinction between upgrades to facilities that the college should  be performing regardless of this game versus achievable initiatives that help us expand or enrich our community. \\ Some ideas about giving more people access to the therapy dogs-- yes, face masks is a great thought; some of the Cause money can be used for that.

Also, we want to broadcast the dog-time on the screens around campus, so people can participate virtually.\\ I think creating a cause may sometimes be intended primarily as a means of raising awareness and support for an service or program that a staff member has, rather than truly trying to ""win"" the $1000. 



That said, I would appreciate more clarity about what the parameters are for an ""appropriate"" cause. As it is, there's really no published guidance on how to craft a cause that will be approved, only feedback after it has already been rejected. Also, some causes don't really explain how the money will be budgeted, and I wish that had been a requirement. Or, if not, it'd be nice if there was a way to ask the cause creator questions and receive responses before having to commit coins.\\ I totally agree!  There really should be another platform though to raise awareness about causes that doesn't involve winning actual money though.  Some of the causes that have been posted seem like they could really use and make an impact with $1000.00.  I also agree that there should be some guidelines posted about the parameters for creating a cause and potentially even information about causes that were rejected and why.  \\ I echo the idea that some of the ""causes"" are really just a way to raise awareness. I think it's important to the integrity of the game that players are able to ""vote"" with their coins for the cause of their choice. The community building is not just about the winning project but about engaging in the process by which the causes are created and build support.\\ I proposed the TV studio update to HD, with the intention to raise awareness of the issue. While there is some equipment we could purchase for $1000, it would of course be a very small dent in a very large project. But the fact that so many people are seeing it, hopefully that will help raise student and staff support when it might one day be a possibility to be funded by the school. \\ For sure.  Raising awareness about facilities that need upgrades is important.  As this is currently the only platform we seem to have where students, faculty and staff can all post/comment/share ideas and frustration it makes sense to have it as a cause.  And yeah, allowing the community to decide makes sense.  But as it stands, the community doesn't really have full disclosure, the institution does. 



I initially posted the comment because a suggested cause to donate money to a local charity was rejected.  I think maybe the problem is that there is no specification on what a cause should or shouldn't be, making it seem like the community could really put anything up to raise awareness aboutwell, anything.  Donating funds with ""no strings attached"" to a local charity seemed like a great way to show we are invested in our community.  And if others felt the same, they would also give coins.  \\ there is a part two but I can't post it.....\\ When the suggested cause was rejected it then became obvious that there were parameters in place as to what we as a community could even option.  Who decides this and based on what standards?  Emerson is clearly trying to brand itself in a particular way, and thus not every cause fits within their projected image. In other words, this read to me as a pretty one side take on the community developing and voting on their own cause(s).  

\\ I think what this does show is the need for a platform where students, faculty and staff can communicate and connect about these issues to get answers about why we haven't upgraded the TV studios.  How has Emerson's priorities shifted in such a way that they haven't been upgraded?  How much does this cost?  What are the obstacles?  Do we as staff, faculty and students disagree with the priorities that Emerson is taking versus how we want the school to evolve? 





Anyway, I'm not trying to instigate anything.  I just thought I would clarify my position better.  \\ okay...nvm."

Victoria Snelgrove was shot and killed in 2004 by the Boston Police Dept. We experienced, first-hand what can happen when police use force against citizenry. 



So why, in 2014 after the killing of Michael Brown by police, and the brutal suppression of the residents of Ferguson by an over-zealous, over-militarized, over-empowered Police Force--did Emerson merely hold a discussion, and invite speakers. We should have been present, been visible, supporting them. Upper echelons of Emerson Administration -- joining with other colleges in our consortia and networks, calling congress, appearing on tv, using our vaunted communications and arts skills to DEMAND that these racist, oppressive tactics by police be stopped and the agents and killers be held accountable.

I asked the student to cut out all the pieces to create the puzzle. As she did it, I said, ""what are you doing?"" She said, ""cutting the pieces.""

9926,,"Administratively, I feel that slowly over the past year the college as a whole has moved closer to a culture of ""yes"" as opposed to the culture of ""no"" that was around for so long. It's refreshing to see departments working together to achieve goals rather than setting up procedures to make it more difficult to get things done. We still have a ways to go, but I feel we're moving in the correct direction...has anyone else noticed this shift?

","YES! (see what I did there? but also, very seriously and emphatically, YES!)\\ I'd say yes BUT... there's only so much money and time! Sometimes I feel like a dreamkiller when I say that I can't work on/support someone's favorite idea. We try to stay faithful to the mission - but sometimes that means hard choices and saying no so that we can say yes to other things."
9926,,"I feel like it's important to empower student employees with actual responsibility and professional experience. We are preparing these students for the real world, not just academically, but in the workforce. It drives me crazy when I hear someone say, ""No, don't give that to a student to do"", or even worse, ""they're just a student"". Let's stop making excuses for our employees just because they're young and they attend classes. If we give them realistic goals and deadlines and trust them with important tasks, I guarantee that in most cases, they'll meet or surpass expectations. If there's one thing I've learned in both teaching and managing, it's that if you don't expect much from someone, you won't get much. Don't lower standards based on what you *think* someone is capable of achieving; instead, teach and set goals at the highest level you hope for, and give your students/staff a chance to rise to success. Our student employees need to be more than just filers, copiers and runners.  ","I couldn't agree more! Our student workers are seeking professional development, challenge, want to engage and empower in meaningful ways! It is so great to see supervisors like you giving them the time, attention, support and trust to contribute. Way to model the way!\\ Totally agree.  At the Library our work study staff are often the people who are most involved in day to day operations and service. They are the face of the library.  We're very fortunate to have an excellent student staff.\\ I feel that in the Campus Center, both at the info desk and the Cabaret, we are given projects to develop our skills in a professional atmosphere. And I love that opportunity! 



It is a realistic expectation of students to meet high deadlines; if a situation occurs then there is always an option to talk with the supervisor. But by setting higher standards it encourages growth, learning, and exploration of the task. Which should be an awesome motivator!\\ I agree and always try to impart some practical employment and business advice along the way.  While I don't have time to teach fully, I do let student workers watch my as I do a mail merge with Word and Excel and ask questions.  This is a basic business function and most undergraduates don't know about he process.  This is just one example.

""Please separate these papers into AR (accounts receivable - including an explanation of what the is) POs (purchase orders - again with a short explanation) and Perkins loan files (again w/exploitation.)"" It doesn't take much longer to explain t the student worker WHY they are doing something, not just how and what to do.\\ I'm with Christina!"

I love all of those visuals and those are things that I often use to brag about Emerson to friends and family who are not familiar with it.

ITG, Media Services, Iwasaki Library, and IT worked together to design and build a Fair Use tool to help faculty assess whether the materials they are using meet fair use guidelines: fairuse.emerson.edu



ITG, Disability Services, and IT worked together to ensure that students with hearing disabilities were able to view course video with closed captioning.

I'd also like to see a partnership with a non-arts school (MIT? BU? Wentworth?) so that students (and staff) would have the opportunity to take more computer science and STEM courses.

That said, as someone who majored in International Relations in undergrad, worked in public television for 10 years, and now works in IT, I would encourage Joanne not to stress about it. Your major in college does not necessarily dictate your career path. Actually, it often does not. Think about the skills that you have that are transferable. You are a writing major and you want to go in to television writing. You will have a great foundation in writing and I think that is what is most important. I bet you could even work your WLP major to your advantage and come up with your own unique style for television writing.

No college can do everything, but we want to use the resources we have - our material resources, our power as a creative community and a community of thinkers, to engage with issues that matter. -- I'd also say that being socially responsible isn't only about responding to problems - it's about looking around us and thinking about how to contribute meaningfully to the world, anticipating need and finding ways to address it. -- Finally, I'm very conscious that we are a community of learners and teachers, and each of us arguably occupies each role at one time or another.

Emerson is a school that is most beneficial to students who want to communicate something or who want to facilitate communication for others. Actors communicate emotions and dialogue written by screenwriters and playwrights. Film students write scripts or assist in shooting to communicate their own idea or the idea of someone else. Marketing majors communicate ideas to promote products. Comm disorders students help others to communicate who may otherwise have difficulty. Emerson is a unique institution. It's conservatory of Communication and expression of ideas. Expression IS Necessary to Evolution and Emerson is at its best when enabling and encouraging expression.",

Of course, Emerson is unlike many other colleges. Our organizations and leadership within our community is extremely unique to our school.

Travel abroad programs are very much Emersonian places where Emerson students wander and share their ideas, but our origins were all founded in Boston. 



As for boundaries within the Boston campus, it's very interesting. Students live just as much throughout Boston as they do on campus. Still though, I feel a separation of work and school when I go home to my off-campus apartment (which I consider to be a nice thing). So there is definitely an attachment that where I learn and where I eat when I learn and participate is where I associate for a campus to be.

Especially the study rooms where I can have complete quiet and concentration for my studies. I feel like there aren't many places for off-campus students to roam to when they are on campus. Because many of us have organizations at night, it isn't worth commuting twice. We would rather stay on campus and have a place to reheat food, relax, study, chat. It would be nice if all of these places would be separate and more diverse rather than encompassing them all into the library. ","If there were separate spaces, like an off-campus student lounge, what activities would you still do in the Library?\\ I suppose that then the library would be more designed for quiet, focused study time which is still a space in high demand for students. 



However, I still think it's important that an off-campus student lounge be considered as more of a relaxing place to eat, socialize, be comfortable and have it be a reasonably sized space because there are many students would use both. 



The separation would provide more space, and allow for specific student needs to be met in both environments.\\ Be sure to check out the Cultural Center, Student Lounge and Quiet Lounges in the Campus Center at 150 Boylston St! They are great places to be in between classes and meetings! We also have microwaves and lockers for off campus students!\\ Walker 10 also has a great little common area that we call Common Ground. It's open for students to work, collaborate, eat, and even just hang out between classes. Plus there are some great offices on this floor that you should check out!\\ I definitely encourage students to check out Walker 10! It's a great space that goes unused by so many. \\ I think that even though living off campus can sound pretty great for a first-time transfer, it can also be intimidating especially when worrying about making friends. I think that if there were a way to initiate just for the first semester in living on campus, transfers wouldn't feel like such outsiders.\\ I was a transfer student and remain an off-campus student, and this rings true. The advice you give to on-campus students: bring layers for the AC on in the winter, bring a lunch AND a dinner if you can't afford EmCaf, join as many clubs as possible, etc. are 10x harder when you trek through the snow on the MBTA for an hour a day and walk with all of your belongings on your back because you have no time between class to stop at a locker (trust me, tried it, when you commute and have all your classes two days a week there is little wiggle room). When I have to leave home at 5:30 AM to make it to an 8 AM class, stay till 11 PM because on-campus students don't seem to understand that the MBTA closes at 12:30 and it is less than fun to commute alone for an hour on the T at midnight, and have nowhere to sit because the sororities use the Max lounge as a meet space at night, I'm done for.

He came off as intimidating to try and force students out of the class. I chose to accept the challenge even though I didn't know what I was in for. I didn't particularly like the content of the course, but my professor made sure to make it a good enough learning experience for those who actually stayed in his 8am course.

10031,,"I think everyone should start to observe elevator adequacy. It's something mentioned during orientation but then forgotten. If someone pushes the button to the 6th floor, and you CLEARLY know that your class is on the 5th floor, it shouldn't mean holding everyone else up by being ""that person"" who decides to push the button anyway. It's not that difficult to take the stairs. ","But perhaps ""that person"" has a specific reason for needing to get off at the 5th floor instead of walking down to it? Sure it's a kind gesture to get off at a floor that isn't yours, but everybody has their own reasons for why they can or can't do things, and this whole ""elevator adequacy"" thing makes it uncomfortable for people who have legitimate reasons to get off on specific floors to do so. Perhaps they injured themselves but the injury isn't visible? That makes it pretty difficult to take the stairs. You just never know what's going on in somebody else's life.\\ There are certain intricacies to it. For example, Colonial residents have to take the elevator down even from the third floor. But Little Building residents can walk, but sometimes the stairs are closed! If it's a class day in Walker and someone goes to 5 when 6 is pressed, that's okay in my book because 5 is a common class floor. There are such weird little idiosyncrasies to it. It all depends on high-volume times and which elevator you are using. That said, I highly believe in elevator ettiquette, but I wish there were a better way. In my opinion, I'd love to see an app much like the T times app that shows elevator wait times. That would be pretty cool and would seriously help people plan accordingly.\\ Caitlin -- whether it is ""that difficult to take the stairs"" changes from person to person, based on their level of ability. that is something for them to assess themselves.\\ As Alex E pointed out, lots of injuries or other reasons why people can't take the stairs are not visible.  They could be invisible physical reasons or psychological or something else entirely.

In 2014 it means something out there that you have completed a field of study from one of the top communications\arts school in the country. 



However, if Emerson wants that degree to mean something in 2020 or 2030 then it will also have to keep up with the ever changing landscape of the industry. It's going to have to make the financial and philosophical commitment to enhance it's programs to something better than status quo.

\\ We actually considered something like this. There's an issue with losing coins though - if you pledge all your coins before trivia, you have nothing to lose.



I suppose you could say the wager is always just on top of the normal coin award so if you have no coins to bet, you can't take advantage of that option. That might be fun, but it still has a few issues.



1) The answer to the trivia is always in a resource, so the obvious right move would be for everyone to bid the max and then get the trivia question correct by reading the resource. This doesn't make it any more of a ""game"" since it's not a strategic choice, but an obvious one.



2) Adding a wagering element increases the complexity, and CPI is supposed to be playable by anyone including people who ""aren't gamers,"" or are not savvy web users. The game is being played in Bhutan later this month, for instance. I'm almost out of characters, so the rest will have to wait. Who's lousy idea was a character limit anyway?\\ Long story short is we decided against any scenario that could result in negative coins, both because we didn't want people confused between positive and negative coin values, because the concept of negative coin values is a little complex for some, and because we didn't want any situation where a player engages meaningfully, but then does not get to have a say in the causes.

I don't think Emerson should fear this, however. I think it should be embraced. EC has already offered a number of MOOCs. There's every reason to continue, and to increase it.

Leaving aside all the amazing people I met, suitemates I still talk to daily, and fond memories of hanging out on the common and eating NYP, I can think of the following things off the top of my head.



First, it was an Emerson professor who put me on the road to copywriting. I was a WLP major who knew he'd write the next great novel. That never materialized, but a career in advertising did. I honed the skills that I use every day in my current work (see item four below) this way.



Second, my semester at the Castle opened up the world outside of the USA to me. Being able to travel extensively in Europe while studying literature and poetry was an opportunity I feel very privileged to have had, and was fundamental to my future.



Third, I started seriously designing games while I was a student at Emerson. I met my co-designer through an Emerson gaming organization, and we've designed dozens of games together, some of which won awards.

9950,,Emerson should have higher level language programs. I have heard that we only have basic level 1 courses for languages because they are simply requirements for students that did not take a consistent for 3 years. I have been studying french for 6 years and I would love to take a course just for fun to improve my speaking. Incorporating more language programs into Emerson would be very helpful for those studying abroad in the Netherlands. Lets keep language alive at a school that was founded on the study of communications.,"seems like a school committed to global engagement should have a range of language offerings!  In the meantime, Katelyn, would you consider starting a French conversation club or something like that?\\ Brilliant point! And a club, or perhaps a way to get a discount at local language classes might work too! Perhaps those could count towards course credit, even! Why not?! :D\\ The library has investigated some language learning websites in the past, but the focus of those has always been exclusively on speaking a language, not reading or writing. With the access to Mango Languages from the Boston Public Library, and the high expenses and high use of our other databases, we haven't prioritized this. Do you think we should? \\ A french conversation club would be a great idea! And i think language should be a priority for any school that has international programs and international students. The discounted language classes also sounds like an awesome idea!\\ Emerson used to offer higher level language courses but they hit their peak in the 1980s/1990s and have been on the decline since.  If we want to engage globally we need to increase our offerings.\\ I totally agree! As a staff person, I would love to use my tuition benefits towards higher level language courses.

We've considered other venues, but it's difficult to find a free space on campus that is not in a residence hall. If it proves to be *too* distracting we'll look for other option.\\ Allergies should be another concern. While I love dogs I'm allergic to most breeds.

In 1994 the internet was such an up and coming thing that Time magazine actually did a cover story about it - just look at this http://techland.time.com/2013/09/29/everything-you-needed-to-know-about-the-internet-in-1994/ - and had to explain the basic premise of why it was important because the average reader what it was. 



How prevalent has the internet become 20 years later? What amazing cultural changes has it wrought across the world? More germane to this question - how could we possibly know what majors will be created/altered 20 years in the future because of some unknowable technological shift?

Having a more enjoyable neighborhood for our campus is ideal, and assisting our communities via service learning is one of the best ways to achieve this. It lets the community know that Emerson cares, and gets the community to care about Emerson as a result.



However, I feel that service learning shouldn't be made a component of more classes. I feel that volunteering for service learning, rather than making it a mandatory part of a grade, is critical. People who want to give their time to assist communities will likely have more drive and dedication toward their service rather than those who are forced to complete service, which should also result in better relations with a community. Yes, making service learning a component of classes could get more people involved, but it could also bring out less dedicated people.",

An on-campus Olympic sized swimming pool is my less-than-reasonable response.) \\ empower people throughout the hierarchal spectrum to take action on their ideas.\\ Interesting, but what does that mean Maureen?\\ If Emerson wants people to take the initiative by seeking out new projects and looking for opportunities to share their ideas and suggestions, our workplace culture needs to change in some ways.  For example: provide many options for expression of ideas so that projects can percolate up (not always from the top down); elimination of barriers--hierarchy of permissions, time constraints; an environment that encourages people to devote part of their time--10 or 20 per cent, maybe--to work on projects of their choosing, even if it's not in their job description; recognition of success, but also recognition for efforts, even if they fail. \\ oh, and fully support the dragon boat team!!!!

It's certainly hard to see at first, but this is why Emerson as an institution has a responsibility to show you how engaging the combination is.\\ Of course philosophy is important.

The same can be said across a broad spectrum of professions, especially in any involving communication and the arts. It definitely is important and I think the school could do more in terms of letting students know that this aligns with the college's mission and that students get stuff out of volunteer work (like the satisfaction of knowing they helped someone else).",

Bikes not Bombs is also a great opportunity, especially for the more mechanically inclined students. Two of my friends volunteered there--you break down bikes to make new ones and ship overseas to youth.



It would also be great to partner with the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund. My grandfather was a veteran who served in the Korean War and my family is very close with other families in the armed forces, so I think it would be a great idea to give back to those who protect and serve.",,

I would encourage her to reach out to the Department Chair and her Academic Advisor (advisor first) and see how feasible it actually is.



The college could integrate a more diverse writing program, in which we expand upon just Screenwriting at the 400 level. They could also make it easier to switch into various departments where applicable (obviously, it's not cool for someone to enter as a WLP and then easily switch into Theatre--they would have to go through the same entrance process as new students HOWEVER, it does make sense that their entry way would be a little easier, considering it's easier to transition roles in a company you're already working in, ie moving from publicity to editorial, than coming in cold).",,

I learned so much about myself, our community, what it really means to be innovative, diverse, and inclusive, and both experiences continue to open my eyes throughout my time at Emerson. Orientation gave me the tools necessary to be successful here at Emerson--it gave me the resources to bring an entire organization from a small gathering to being SGA recognized and enabled me to get to the point where I could take so many risks, fail spectacularly, but still succeed enough that I could do something as amazing as attend San Diego Comic Con as press for Emerson's official entertainment magazine!",,#OL4Life

Studios, and the Editor-in-Chief of Dark Horse! It was a fantastic networking opportunity and I learned so much about my industry.",,
9846,Weekly,"Honestly, it varies. I find that the more conflict I have in my classes and in my organizations, the more I learn after collaborating with others in overcoming challenges or seeking out advice from many of the experienced staff and faculty members.



This past week, I had a ton of conversations with the Director of Student Activities Jason Meier about organizations and how my actions--although I think are helpful--actually enable others' behavior, behaviors that can cause harm in the organization. Today, I got the opportunity to attend a webinar with Sharon Duffy and Josh Hamlin on managing students as their peers, and learned a lot just by asking them questions about what they though!

I get the merits of safety, but as a student who live on campus for the past two and half years, I never felt unsafe with the doors open. I think the best argument that I've heard against the ""tap and go"" system is that Emerson is all about inclusivity and engaging with the community and being a part of the community; the ""tap and go"" system literally separates us from the community. Doesn't that go against President's Pelton's initiative of ""to engage and assist nearby communities""? (Mostly to engage)","Definitely not a fan, particularly during class-switching. But it's probably cheaper than having a uniformed guard on every floor during all open hours. We also don't have the space to support a more open campus - even the grad students usually can't fit in the library or find an available space to work for more than 20 minutes. we all suffer with Tap&Go, but no one mor than the poor entryway guards, who hear that horrible beeping all hours of the day. \\ After hearing stories of people (homeless people, irate Bostonians, etc) chasing students into the dorms/buildings from the streets/sidewalks, I definitely feel the uptick in safety by using the Tap & Go system outweighs the slight inconvenience. If people just keep their IDs in-hand as they're switching classes, it doesn't take that much extra time. You can still mingle with non-Emerson folk in the Common/outside class, or sign them in if you already know them or anticipate their arrival.\\ I've had a lot of unsavory experiences in the area surrounding Emerson, so I appreciate the effort to keep us safe. What bothers me is that the use of the system isn't consistent between guards.  "

9180,"""Socially responsible"" to me would mean in two particular dimensions: outward-facing and inward-facing. Outwardly: are we addressing sustainability, not just environmentally, but socially? When we train media producers, do we train them to think reflexively about the structures they'll join or will create? The problems of global climate change, war and violence, structural racism/sexism/name-an-ism are intimately tied to what gets covered in the media, who gets to cover it, opportunities to engage with it. I would hope an Emerson student doesn't learn just to join the machine but to question what that machine is encouraged to produce explicitly or implicitly going forward and decides to go where the silences lay (or better yet, create mechanisms to address them entirely). It would mean a campus that also takes a realistic view of its effects on its surrounding community and maintains active communications with those it affects and holds itself accountable. This can extend, obviously, well beyond Chinatown.



Inwardly: upon arrival I was pleased to see the steps that have been taken to address power-based violence on campus. These were really progressive steps which are ongoing. A socially responsible campus doesn't just foster an environment in which we operate in terms of mutual respect, but recognizes that constant dialogue is necessary to address how we replicate structural inequalities even when our best of intentions results in otherwise. Here structures of accountability are key as well.",,

I would say that from conversations I've had with old friends (and given my partner used to live in Chinatown, albeit before the Ritz went up) basic life has changed dramatically in the area in recent years, and I imagine a squeeze is on for whoever remains. I don't have actual data, so this is off-the-cuff, of course. Our presence certainly will have an effect on the policing of the population around the nearby shelter. Emerson brings a great deal to Boston in so many ways, as well, surely, to the local community; I'm certainly terrifically pleased to be a part of it and wouldn't have come here if I felt otherwise. Its interactions with the political economy of nearby areas will simply be complicated and are likely considered by our neighbors via implicit mechanisms rather than overt communications from us.

""Service learning"" can be a positive experience for all involved, or it can result in stop-start short-term relationships, little reflection, an 'individualization' of the issues addressed by an organization as opposed to tying the filled need to broader social/structural issues. The broader context needs to be considered and real partnerships need to be established (with deep reflection of the organization's/community's needs alongside the structure needed by the school), otherwise more harm than good can result, with voluntarism-as-a-solution taking precedence over a realization of possibilities of broader policy or political change.

Here's my suspicion (also voiced elsewhere). The gamemasters will take the data from responses, and then throw all the comments into a Wordle, then identify the phrases and concepts that leap out most prominently and see if any of those guide them in coming up with a plan for what to do. 



If this is the case, I really, really hope these things come through: A) Dogs in the library, B) Do something with Remingtons, the dead furniture store, and the long-dead bookstore, C) The Dragon-boat team needs institutional support, and D) Lots of structural reforms are needed. Particularly in Emerson's relationship with Chinatown.



What I worry is going to be most prominent is ""Cowabunga."" But now it's my fault, too.  \\ dragon boat team, dragon boat team, dragon boat team . . . \\ The goal is to foster meaningful conversation about Emerson's present and future, and engage more of the community in that conversation.



As you can see, the challenge questions in Mission 2 are a good deal more thoughtful (or at least require a lot more thought to answer) than the ones in Mission 1. It's more than just cheering for our team. Where is the college heading? What should its goals be? What is it doing successfully, and what more should we be doing? What are the values of the stakeholders in the Emerson Community.



Even if we don't fully answer these questions, it's good to get more people thinking and talking about them.\\ I find value in the opportunity that the game provides to take some time to reflect on my Emerson experience, the college's strategic initiative and my role in shaping the Emerson's future.  Doing this as part of a community forum is an added plus.

On the flip side, the amount of talent, ambition, and drive in the student body of Emerson also forces you to question your own talents and goals. Sometimes this can force you to work harder (I would say in the Sophomore-Junior time frame this was the case), but other times it can be a bit debilitating if you let it (I think Freshman and Seniors who are comparing themselves to others in their first foray into workshop-style classes or the job world experience this more).

Also, because we are so focused in engaging in successful business strategies in our respective creative fields, investing in YA and having classes about the genre and its transformation of pop culture over time would be incredibly useful. (This train of thought also applies to the fantasy genres, which of course have a bigger problem in terms of lending themselves to longer pieces of work than writing classes typically allow.)","I believe there used to be a kids/YA lit concentration within WLP...which is why the Library has a children's book collection\\ Yes, at least there were classes.  Jack Gantos used to teach here.  Who else wants to see a childrens/YA concentration here?\\ I mean, there's been such a large insurgence of YA lit in recent years. I think it would be useful to explore what made those books/series so successful and why they resonated so much with young audiences.\\ There has been a start back to Genre styled writing... There is a Noir class being offered, and even the Utopian/Dystopian lit class can be seen as a move towards a more welcoming atmosphere for various genre classes. I speak as a fantasy fanatic...



(Also both classes are awesome.)\\ Kevin Miller is wonderful, and one of the fiction professors I've had that didn't shy away from genre fiction, which I appreciated. I understand that, given the structure of the workshop classes, it's hard to world-build in 15 pages or less effectively, but maybe that means offering more classes based in long-form writing. Novel-writing seems to be the most effective means of generating income, yet the fiction courses are overwhelmingly focused in short story writing. And I understand you need to start small, learn the basics then expand on it, but maybe a move toward more genre writing can be coupled with a few novella/novel-writing classes (which I think would be useful regardless of a genre focused curriculum)."

9703,"Why do you only kiss me when you're drunk?

I remember meeting you for the first time

And thinking that you seemed cool

I remember thinking, ""I want to get to know that guy.

We would be great friends.""

And that's all I wanted to be...

Your friend

And then we became kind of sort of friends

The kind that acknowledges each other on the street outside and asks how are you

And seems like they actually want to know the real answer

The kind that when you run into them at a party and you're both drunk and I'm ""So happy to see you I'm so glad we're friends and let's spend more time together""

But in the days that follow we go back to being polite

Why do you only kiss me when you're drunk?

Flash forward to the night before everything changes

No not the night where you drunkenly kiss me for the first time and I'm confused but I liked it

Not the night when I realize I want you to kiss me after listening to your beautiful voice softly crooning while a guitar plucked seductively by someone else's hands plays in the background

No, flash forward to the night where I see you and you see me and yes you're drunk but I'm not and we run to each other and you pick me up and spin me around and say I'm so glad we're going to be together for the next three months.

No we aren't dating

We're going away with 80 other people on a European adventure

This is the night before everything changes because if neither of us got on that plane I wouldn't be writing this poem

Why do you only kiss me when you're drunk?

That night

When you kissed me

I thought it was a fluke

Yes our lips touched over and over and over But still

I thought it was a one time thing

Something that I should hold onto

But also forget

But then you kissed me again the next week and not just once

And while it was happening all I could think was

This isn't a fluke, he wants to kiss me as much as I want to kiss him

But when will he kiss me sober?

You held my hand that night and for some stupid reason even though I thought I learned my lesson after all the years of heartbreak

I thought it meant something

But then you barely talked to me all week

Why won't you kiss me when you're sober?

And not only sober but even high

It's only when you're drunk

It's like there's something in you that says ""It's only ok to kiss her when you're drunk""

You know usually people use being drunk as an excuse to be more honest about how they feel

They use it as a shield to keep from getting hurt

""I said I loved you last night? Lol my bad I was so drunk I had no idea what I was saying I didn't really mean it""

Crisis averted

But you?

I don't know why you only kiss me when you're drunk

Do you like me more than you let on and you don't want to risk what we have as friends?

Or do you only like me when you're drunk?

Because sober kissing

When you kiss someone sober there is more involved

That means you do like someone as more than a friend

Maybe it's just as a fuck buddy

Maybe it's as a potential Significant Other

But for whatever reason

You don't like the idea of only being platonically associated with them

You wouldn't intentionally kiss someone you don't like when you're sober unless you're an asshole

So do you like me

Or do you only think I'm interesting when we're both drunk and our bodies move in unison when we dance

Your hands on my waist, mine on your shoulders

Holding our audience captive because they've never seen anything so raw and intense yet lighthearted and playful?

Would you only sober pity-kiss me?

If you kissed me sober would you realize you actually don't like me as much as you thought?

What if you kissed me sober and it was great but nothing happened afterwards?

What if something did happen but somewhere down the line you get bored with me and I add yet another failure check to my list of former flames?

You know what?

Nevermind

Don't kiss me when you're sober

I don't know if I can handle it

Let's get outta here

And maybe get a drink or two

We need to be better at making students feel like the school still cares after they move off-campus","I like the Tap and Go Program and find the ivisitor site to be very user friendly! I am curious if others think it is problematic to allow students to tap into the lobbies of the residence halls?\\ Another problem is if, as a student, I had a production that went until Midnight in the Cabaret, and I needed that quick bite from the Max around 11PM, I can't get back into the Little Building without someone getting me.



I love what Tap and Go has done, I just feel that for off-campus students that need access past 11PM, whether it's for access to a convenience store or to their workplace/meeting space, it needs to be looked at.\\ Too add onto Jasmine's comment...even for on-campus students, it takes a good 10-20 seconds to actually read your ID and unlock the door at night, which is a long time if you feel unsafe. How can you safely escape someone harassing you if there's a delay getting into the building?\\ The fact that off-campus students (or any students) feel unsafe waiting on the street at night to get into an EC building is out of step with the College's focus on Violence Prevention and Response.  



Could the tapping be adjusted so that they can at least get into the lobby areas of the school's buildings?\\ Absolutely! I just think its completely unreasonable that the school is trying to keep out people who don't go to Emerson by keeping out everyone who doesn't live on campus. Off-campus students are people too!

I'd be happy to bring her around the dorms during finals!\\ What's more, the new enclosed space in the library where the Will and Grace set used to be would be a great place to put the dogs! It's enclosed so people can still do work in the library but big enough to have a good amount of people.\\ I will gladly help out with this however I can. And why just at finals time--it's not as if that's the only stressful time. It would great if it were a monthly event.\\ Nice idea, Miranda!

Monthly visits from dogs would be excellent, and if the visits gather participants together for stress-reduction and camaraderie, well, it sounds very Emersonian to me!

Why should students wear a face mask? Should students have to suffer with these symptoms: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pet-allergy/basics/symptoms/con-20028932 I speak from experience. I'm allergic to many breeds and when I'm in a room that a dog had PREVIOUSLY been and had been cleaned, I am unable to breathe and I don't have asthma. This is a liability. 

Also, allergies don't work that way. Dander is not easy to clean. Seriously, either consider getting so-called hypo-allergenic breeds or do not do it. Nice thought but not thought out. ","This little one would work: http://www.petstew.com/border-terriers.html\\ Or a Cubanito...

\\ Cindy, because the organization we're trying to partner with is volunteer-based, it is likely we cannot request only specific breeds. We are working to make sure the dog-occupied space will be contained, and cleaned to prevent severe suffering. We will be recommending persons with allergies invest in medications, but cannot provide medications. Face-masks are likely doable, with apologies available free of charge if this is insufficient. Thank you for raising this concern, and backing it up with statistics. This will affect our planning, but not our resolve to see this come through. (As has been pointed out, many other institutions have solved these issues. We will find a way!) \\ The dog pictured in the promotion for the cause is a hypoallergenic dog (poodle) so I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility to work to accommodate people with allergies.\\ Our hope is that the impact of the therapy dogs on campus would be no more severe than the presence of sight or hearing assistance dogs, who have access to buildings like the Library because of the ADA. That is one of the reasons that we want to hold our program in a non-residence building and in a space that can be closed off. \\ As a dog lover who has allergies, if we can work this out it will be a win-win.

I'm disappointed with the so-called causes that people have come up with. What's next, our own personal barista? ","Well...community can also be anything that draws our community closer together.  It's not limited to charities or outside causes.  If it helps Emerson students and/or faculty get to know eachother and become a tighter knit community, then in my opinion it's a worthwhile cause.\\ That's one way to look at it. But I've found that when people work to help others it builds a strong bond that lasts a lifetime. \\ Some causes that were advocating to donate the money to a good cause were rejected because they weren't sustainable/long term, unfortunately.\\ Which ""causes"" do you find problematic? I know mine is for popcorn (which obviously isn't going to make the top three that get funded) but the idea is to encourage engagement in the cinema where we encourage dialogue on important issues (like the panel you served on for Documented). I would have rather raised funds for a student community engagement manager, but that wasn't likely to attract enough interest.\\ so . . . dragon boat team! we are Emerson people, interacting with people from the larger community, practicing collaboration/teamwork, giving Emerson visibiltity in the community . . . though we're not a charity, I feel we are doing good!\\ To me a cause should benefit others, not just ourselves. I consider concessions and charging stations amenities. The charging stations idea is a bad one because everyone has a way to charge their devices. There are outlets everywhere and most of us have nomophobia  the fear of being without your mobile phone. It's real. Look it up! So why would anyone need it. It will be obsolete in a year, anyway, as there will likely be some new way to power our mobile devices. If it were solar, I'd see it as a cause as it would help conserve energy. Concessions aren't something we should push, either, because it's junk food. Popcorn is an empty calorie snack as are most other concessions. It won't bring more people to the theater. Good programming and a time slot that makes sense for students is more likely to bring in an audience. "

So I gave a new exam that had lots of the same technical questions and some additional problem sets but allowed the students to use any possible method to get the answer.  They could work together, use the internet, call their friends, call film labs, use books they had with them - anything, really.  There was one catch, they had to get all of the questions right before they could check out equipment for a project.

Also where do you like to trick or treat in Boston.  I hear Beacon Hill has some great places to go.","When I was a student at Emerson I went trick or treating on Beacon Hill once. I dressed up as the Statue of Liberty. (Bonus: my last name is Liberty). 



I felt awkward trick-or-treating though. Every time somebody opened their door and saw it was 20 year olds, you could tell they were exasperated. They gave us candy, but it was clear they'd rather be giving it to kids, and thought what we were doing was pretty silly.



In retrospect, it was.\\ Beacon Hill is amazing for trick or treat. People there start planning in August.



Unrelated story: when I was a kid my babysitter told me a story of when she went trick or treating as a teenager. She knew that no one wanted to give candy to a teen, so when the door opened she was ready as a ghost: sheet draped over her as she knelt down. Once she got the candy, she stood up, waved, walked away.\\ As a trick or treat hander-outer, I hate when adults go trick or treating. They should be giving out candy, not taking it from, well, babies.\\ I always respected idea my freshman class council came up with a few years ago.. ..the students went trick or canning. They would get dressed up in costumes,  went to Beacon Hill and asked for donations of non perishable food items for the Greater Boston Food Bank.  They got to dress up but for a good cause!  They also got lots of candy too for their good deed. \\ I went trick-or-treating on Beacon Hill two years ago and some guy refused to give me and my friend candy about 20 minutes into the ordeal. We were so upset that we didn't want to knock on any more doors so we just went to CVS, bought our own candy, and went home.



I'm not really big on parties in general so trick-or-treating was really my only means of celebrating. College is such an awkward in-between time for people who don't have their own houses to give OUT candy to trick-or-treaters, but if you don't like parties you're kind of stuck sitting at home.

Re: The Bio of this Empathy Question

There is not possible way that Dawn could have double majored in WLP and Communications Disorders AND pick up a Marketing minor. I know many students who can't even figure out a way to double major. Especially those who are majoring in Communications Disorders because that is an extremely intensive program. Many of the students majoring in Communication Disorders don't even have time to take on minors.



Also, she would not have been able to pick up at Marketing minor during her Senior year. I know several students who tried to minor in Marketing starting during their Sophomore year and were not able to get into the classes they needed by the end of Senior year and ended up having to drop the minor. There aren't enough classes for everyone who wants to minor in Marketing to do so and while it is feasible to pick up some minors Senior year, especially if you have already fulfilled many of the requirements, Marketing is barely feasible to minor in for those who start ahead. 



I think this question says a lot about how it's very different to be on the student side when it comes to majors and minors. As students we experience many road blocks in what we can and cannot do. Students have a whole lot of freedom but not as much as many of the staff and faculty think they do. ",,

9338,"Switching from Writing, Literature, and Publishing to Writing for Film and Television can be an feasible switch especially during Sophomore year when she could still easily fit VMA pre-requisites in her schedule but it also may not be possible. VMA is the hardest of the majors to switch into from what I've understood from people who tried to switch into it but I've known people who have made the switch happen.



The College should allow her to switch because by sophomore year in the WLP department she would just be getting into her writing classes as most of freshmen year is general education requirements except for one writing class. Interests change and the college should allow that to happen. I understand how there are VMA requirements which may make it difficult but for Writing for Film and Television the emphasis should be on the writing anyways.



I have also seen people who were unable to switch use the Writing, Literature, and Publishing courses to their advantage while using extracurricular activities and helping with their friend's projects to get the film background they need. WLP has a screen writing class and a novel into film lit class that she could easily take. She could join THREAD and SPEC to get screen writing experiences while helping with other projects. I've seen people use this method to get what they needed when they couldn't get the support from the academic side of Emerson.



The College should be allowing more fluidity in switching majors. At the present moment it feels rigid and I know some people feel stuck in the major that they come in with. At Emerson we present as a very focused school but even the most focused people can change their minds once they get different experiences. If you've never tried writing a script before, you might not realize it's what you actually love. Emerson is nurturing in many aspects but doesn't always allow students to explore interdepartmentally which is a shame. As I student I minored in Photography which was the only thing in the VMA Department that a student could minor in if they were not within the department. A student shouldn't have to create their own major to be able to explore different aspects of the academic community. ",,I agree! We should be more connected between departments

My teachers tried to foster my need for creativity and knowledge but there was only so much that could be done without the peer feedback that I needed.



Emerson's community help me grow immensely in so many different ways. My view of the world has changed and I think more critically about the world around me. When I go home there are things I didn't notice before but I notice now. Such as how the people of my town use language and word choice. I'm not sure if I'm more of a risk taker because of the Emerson environment but I am definitely thinking more critically about my choices.

One of the stronger essays of my thesis:



Saint Denis



Sometimes I feel like I grew up in church. Spending my Sunday mornings kneeling on a hard stool, head bowed, elbows propped up on the pew in front of me. Muttering the same prayers that we said every week, not bothering to use the little red books with their faded gold crosses on the covers because I had them memorized. Walking slowly up the alter for communion where I kneeled and waited as the priest came with the wafers and wine. That one sip of one sweet wine the only alcohol I was ever allowed by my parents, savoring it on my tongue as I made my way out into the small hallway and back into the main church. I grew up sitting up at the front of the church in the childrens choir. Performing for the Congregation as the Angel who told Mary she was blessed with a child in the annual Christmas pageant. I grew up in a church but I grew up in the wrong one.

The lifeblood of any mill town was the church. In Douglas we have a quite a few. The largest is probably the Congregational church that sits in the middle of downtown and down the street is the Methodist church all decked out in red. But the real church of Douglas is the Catholic church, Saint Denis. A large brick church just a few mintues from downtown, past Soliders field and a left onto Manchaug street. A nice white statue of a saint standing outside.



Most of the kids in my school went to Saint Denis but I attended an Episcopal church in the town over. They went to Sunday Mass while I went to the Sunday Service. They grew up in CCD while I went to Sunday School. They ended

 

their Lords prayer with but deliver us from evil while I went on to say For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. For ever and ever. Amen. Our services basically exactly the same, except I am Protestant and they are Catholic.

I am pale and covered with constellations of freckles. My face is round and I have a bit of a double chin when I smile. My hair is light brown with bursts of red. My Irish side is always shining through. My Dad one hundred percent Irish, his ancestors coming from Ireland only a few generations before him. He grew up in a small house with three other brothers and a sister in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Pawtucket being home to a large Irish population and has an excellent Saint Patricks Day Parade (I know, I marched it with my high school band five years in a row). He also grew up Catholic.

My mother is the cause of my Episcopal upbringing. My father wasnt a practicing Catholic when they got married so they got married in a Protestant church. I dont think my Grammie approved much but since my mother was the one who went to church we ended up Episcopal. We started going to Trinity and after a while my mother even got my dad to start coming.

My dads family jokes with him as they have all remained Catholic. His eldest brothers wife, Aunt Debbie, being the most religious of them all. She used to hoard bottles of Holy Water in her house that she had specially blessed by the Priest (to this day I am still unsure of what she did with it). One anniversary of my Grammies death we went to a Catholic service at Aunt Debbies church that was dedicated to my Grammie. I pretended I was Catholic and got communion. On the way home my dad stopped by one of his favorite bakeries. It felt like a little glimpse into the Catholic life I could have had.

 

I know Saint Denis as well as Trinity. I could make it from one end of the large finished basement to the other in the dark if I needed to. A spent a lot of time volunteering at the church with my Girl Scout troop, at least one of my leaders was always an active member and the rest of my troop spent their Sunday mornings (or sometimes Saturday nights) there. We would clean around the alter or organize the room behind the stage. There were Girl Scout bridging events held on the stage in the basement. The church also hosted many town functions. I went to a Christmas Eve Service on year, staying seated while everyone else went to get communion. My Baccalaureate was held at Saint Denis right before I graduated high school. While I didnt officially go to Saint Dennis it was a central place of my childhood as a gathering place for the town.

I remember the first time I went into the church and discovered the little bowls of Holy Water that stuck out from the wall. Trinity didnt have such things. I splashed my small fingers into one of the bowls and brought them towards my lips. I couldnt figure out why the water was there or its purpose. It was explained to me that it was Holy Water but that was all. Every time I went back I would dip my fingers in the water hoping that something would happen.

When I try to explain being Episcopal it kinda always goes like this: Its as close to being Catholic as you can get without actually being Catholic. We just dont care about the Pope or pray to the Saints or think that the wafers at communion are literally Christs body. Other than that, its basically the same thing. So, I was as close to having the same religious beliefs as my dads side of the family, as the other kids at school, as I could possibly get but never quite there. Always a step removed.

 

Every time I explained how Episcopalian beliefs different from Catholicism to my peers I found it hard to explain my own beliefs. I dont necessarily align with my church either because I believe that there are many pathways to God and every religion is a way to get to him. I dont think it matters if you are Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Hindi, Buddhist, any incarnation of religion or spirituality. I believe that these are all just different pathways. I think these beliefs partially stem from watching Joan of Arcadia as a child as that television show preached a similar message and partially from the fact that I dont believe that a true forgiving God would write someone off for following the pathway to spirituality that fits them. I believe in heaven but sometimes the idea of eternal life is exhausting to me and I wouldnt mind if when my life on earth ends that it really is the end. But there are so many complexities to what I believe that it was always just easier to say that Im Episcopal and leave it there unless someone inquired further.

The priest at Saint Denis for a long time was Father Bill. As Mary says, the man wanted to retire but the congregation just wouldnt let him. He was a strict Catholic priest in a very old school way. The Catholic church was starting to change but on many issues my classmates started to feel uncomfortable. I was told, in hushed tones of horror, that one service they passed around papers to all the girls in the church. They were contracts Father Bill wanted them to sign saying that they wouldnt get an abortion. My friend Madilyns grandmother tried to get her to sign it but she refused.

While this was happening at Saint Denis the pastor at my church was driving away members of the congregation with his anti-gay stand. The Episcopal

 

church had just elected a gay woman bishop and Father Sutton was not happy about it. His sermons made me and a lot of the members of the church uncomfortable. I shifted awkwardly in my seat a town away from my friends at Saint Denis who were in a similar situation.

Because I didnt go to Saint Denis the fact that I was religious often remained unseen by classmates. Every so often it would come up in a class discussion about religion or Protestantism. I would give my spiel about how Episcopal was as close to being Catholic as you could get without being it. But often my peers couldnt seem to believe that I went to church just as regularly as them. My attendance was unseen and therefore unrecognized.

And some days I wish I had grown up Catholic. I often felt like I missed out on things growing up because I wasnt part of CCD like it seemed the rest of my grade was. They bonded over the absurd things that they did during their CCD classes. I got confirmed when I was in eighth grade, I kneeled in front of the church as the Bishop put his hands on my head and shook my whole body. I felt like he was trying to shake all the sin out of me. All of my classmates who went to Saint Denis got confirmed during our senior year. They went on a weekend long retreat and on Monday it was all they were talking about, even the ones who didnt take much stock in their faith expressed that the weekend had been an emotional one. I sat at the lunch table with nothing to contribute. I wondered if their bishop would shake their heads so hard it felt like he was trying to shake out their sin.

I sometimes feel like a traitor to my Irish heritage because Im Protestant.



I want to feel connected to my classmates as well as my heritage. My religion,

 

even though it mirrors my beliefs better than Catholicism, separated me from my town as well as my history.

I had always dreamed of visiting Ireland and I finally got to visit Dublin.



But the entire trip I was torn between my Irish looks and my Protestant upbringing. The tour guide talked about the wars waged between the Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. How Protestantism in Ireland is just a side affect of British Imperialism. I had already read so much about it in an Irish Literature class I took as an online elective in high school but it felt so real being there. I felt like it was my fault. The Protestant part of me wiping away the Irish Culture. A traitor of the heritage I cling to as an American who is always looking towards her ancestors for identity.

When I went to Saint Denis I always imagined what it would have been like if my dad had been a practicing Catholic. Its a weird thing to want to be Catholic when they were historically less powerful than the Protestants. The Irish Catholics having to scrap for jobs while the White Angelo Saxon Protestants took charge. Just like in Ireland. Yet, in Douglas it was the reverse. I was the minority and I wanted so badly to fit in, in some little way.

Living away from Douglas I dont attend a church in Boston. I have my beliefs but Ive never summoned the courage to walk into a church alone, even though most of the churches I pass have the Episcopal sign out front. Church, to me, is about community and while I know that churches want to welcome new members into their folds I always feel like I would be intruding on an already established community. So, on Sundays I worship through doing the things I love and thanking God for all the good things in my life. The people I keep in touch

 

with from Douglas dont often go to church either. In that way we are now the same but many of them have lost their faith, if they ever had it to begin with. I believe in God and I liked my Sundays at Trinity but there will always be a weird feeling about what could have been.

With our faculty support there is not much you can do.","I'm curious about what you mean by your last sentence ""With our faculty support there is not much you can do.""



Where does support for faculty currently live at Emerson?  Is it in the departments, or is there overarching support in Academic Affairs, or does it live somewhere else?  More importantly, what kind of support would be helpful and focused directly on the issues you and other faculty face?  



I ask because In Disability Services, we work with faculty all the time, asking them to make accommodations to give students access to course content and process.  There is often an accommodation that requires the faculty to go above and beyond, and we make every effort to be available and provide resources.  But obviously, this kind of support is only part of the faculty role.  



What are best practices at other institutions for faculty support?  \\ well Diane..a great question. Some support lives in departments and some in AA. But for me as a Liberal Arts faculty it has been rather limited unto now because we were spread across the college. In terms of what kind of support I'm sure it varies based on the faculty memberfor me Id like more time for research not just a sabbatical but more respect for research time overall. That is what gives my teaching its credibility after all. Id also like more library resources devoted to faculty needs ( I'm sure there is a lot that I don't know about) and id like a good research assistant ( a stunt who could be trained to do research up port). but i know other faculty must have other needs.

thanks for the question tho..its great one!

9097,"My first year teaching I had a very disruptive student in class who threatened my physically. I took it to the proper authorities based on the instructions given. I was told to "" be more understanding"" in froth of the student and the student was put back in my class.  I lost faith in the ability of the college to 1. Protect its faculty or the students 2. Protect a learning atmosphere 3. Provide a valuable leaning experience. The focus on ""good "" teaching as a measure of success made me take less risks in pedagogy and curriculum building. The the lack of focus until recently on academic excellence for faculty made me seek creativity elsewhere. Finally, the Gordian knot of administrative and beauracratic red tape at Emerson makes one expend much energy in getting around and through the system, not in other ways.

I think there are a couple of competing trends in the ed tech industry that can take the future in different directions.



Less favorable:

Apple / Amazon / Google / Microsoft / textbook publishers continue with their battle to create walled ecosystems containing proprietary content. As a consequence of the battle, they end up consolidating so that there are a max of two giant companies that can offer everything you want with enormous convenience... as long as you play by their rules. Targeted advertising is ubiquitous and seen as normal and helpful. You pick a system to use (hardware and software and shopping and etc), and it is almost impossible to switch. In this vision DRM and copyright laws are very strong and dramatically limit the re-use, re-mixing and sharing of content. IT in this vision would be supporting the two ecosystems, probably hiring entirely different staff for each one. In this future, people are largely consumers.



Potentially more favorable:

The push towards creative commons, open textbooks, open source software continues. It becomes normal for every program to have an extensive API (APIs allow you to transfer data in and out of programs). You own your data, and programs/businesses have clear rules about how to export it. In this future IT is busy creating new ways for people to make sense of all this information - but in this vision the faculty and staff also have a lot more IT expertise and take on much of the work themselves. The problems with this vision are a) how will businesses make money and b) it is a lot more work for people to build their own things than to rely on large companies to build for them.



I think in either case, the days of computing/technology belonging only to IT are over. Everyone in the future will have a higher level of technological competence (10 years ago I couldn't have imagined doing half the things I take for granted now). One of the main questions that remains is if we will be competent in using tech to shape our reality, or if we will be competent in knowing what buttons to press from a bunch of pre-selected options.",,Spoken like a director of instructional technology and TIE alum :-)

Plays and musicals are often an outlet in which actors portray characters with serious issues or dilemmas that people face in real life.

If you're questioning why you are learning something, or even if you're learning anything at all, that can definitely be an issue, especially since Julian is paying to attend Emerson; he should be getting everything that his money is paying for. But, what Julian may not realize is that he doesn't need to be a philosophy major for this information to help him out. As a film major, Julian can take the information he is learning from this philosophy to enhance a film project he is working on. Maybe this class helps him see a different perspective on philosophy he never thought of before. That's the nice thing about Emerson; no matter what class you take, in some way it could benefit you no matter what you major in. ",,

I can say that Emerson is a school like no other I've ever attended.

I have been forced to break out of my shell and communicate with others, even after only being here for one month. ",

There are many interesting ideas that have become developed because of feminism and the desire for gender equality, and there are many types of branches of feminism that are unknown to most people. Women's studies is a popular topic that more people are becoming interested in everyday.

For example, instead of going to eat at Panera or the Dining Hall, I could choose to go to a local mexican restaurant, or explore what there is to offer in Cambridge. Exploring food options away from campus can help a student become exposed to what the city has to offer. Also, I expose myself to culture in the city by attending concerts and theatrical performances in the city.

8982,,"A lot of people have mentioned the importance of finding a mentor.  How do people do that at Emerson? I'd be interested in hearing from students, staff, and faculty--your best tips on finding a mentor.  And how does the relationship evolve?  Is it formal, informal, or what?","I haven't found a mentor at Emerson per se but I do have a professional mentor.  I have also participated in mentoring programs where you are paired with someone.  In my experience the ""forced"" pairing doesn't work as well as the organic pairing.  I found my mentor just through networking and mutual interests.  I'm currently reaching out to someone outside of my department to learn more about her work which closely relates to my work so we'll see how that goes!\\ Hey Maureen! Someone from Career Services just came to speak to my class on Thursday about a database on their website of all Emerson graduates and where they work. She spoke as if this was a great way to get in touch with people in our fields.\\ I think mentor/mentee relationships form organically and maybe without you even realizing it. You want a mentor that you connect with and can have conversations about meaningful things. Eventually, this is the person that you will go to whenever you have decisions to make or obstacles to overcome. Mentors are the people whose advice you trust and that you look up to for what they've accomplished in their professional and personal lives. "

8982,,"What do people think of the changes at WERS over the years?  when I'm out in the community, WERS is something that people always mention about Emerson, and usually in a very positive way.  Having been here for  . . . awhile! . . . I've seen lots of changes . . . like the switch to underwriting, the professional AM host, programming changes . . . do you think they have improved the station, or watered down some of what made it unique?","The changes make me a little sad. I miss the gritty college radio vibe that WERS used to have.\\ Me too.  I also miss the diversity of programming we used to have.  I've heard similar remarks from non-Emerson listeners.\\ I like the current mix of music, it definitely fills the void that was made when WFNX went off the air... they are trying to make inroads to the Boston radio scene rather than just continue to be the best College Radio station (which they have been for a while). I found the old ""Rockers"" show un-listenable, and would switch stations immediately.\\ I only started listening to WERS a year or two ago after WFNX went off the air. So I can't speak to the past. But I do love WERS during the week and particularly love George & Tory in the mornings. As long as students still have the chance to be on air and run things, I don't see how having one professional personality in the morning is a problem. I think George brings a great vibe to the station and if it raises the overall visibility (not to mention listeners and donors) to the station, i think that's a good thing.\\ When I mention I work at Emerson people usually first mention WERS, an how much they love it. It still has a huge following regardless of the changes. \\ hmmm . . . but some people may have stopped listening . . .(I know one person who did, because she hates the AM radio banter between George and Tory)  I wasn't a huge Rockers fan, but it made our programming much more diverse and unique. \\ I thought WERS was at its best about five years ago in terms of the music they played. Right now they're basically indistinguishable from The River most hours of the day. I liked it more when students were doing the programming. But if the station is more successful now, who am I to complain?



\\ I guess it depends on our definition of successful radio.  Do we want to be uniquely Emersonian or do we want to be, as Sam L says, ""basically indistinguishable from The River""?"

IT has formed a Service Excellence agreement that we are trying extremely hard to hold ourselves to.



http://it.emerson.edu/page/service-excellence-commitment



These are some base guidelines that will keep our department accountable for the work we do, and the services we offer.

","If you're trying to call people or departments out, you need to be more specific. Without specifics, I have trouble buying into the lines you're selling. 



Good on IT for implementing improvement measures!

But if you want the opportunity to fail and learn, ask your constituents which of their standards you aren't meeting. \\ My intention was not to call out any individuals or departments. I don't think a public space would be appropriate. 



If anything I would ask departments to look at their core services/responsibilities and see what practices they could improve on to make it easier for the Emerson community and our external affiliates.\\ I've been at Emerson since 2004 and I can't say is I've had any similar experiences to what's described; I find my colleagues to be very dedicated and hardworking. Service excellence, of course, is something that can always be improved and its great for any department to illuminate those guidelines for everyone.

\\ I DO like the Service Excellence Agreement!  It's very clear and well-written, and having the expectations in print is an excellent idea.\\ Have you asked these staff and faculty people if they are full time and salaried with benefits?  You'd be surprise how many people here are only paid hourly and only have so many hours per week. Though I think that many are going above and beyond though they are not paid to do that.  The college relies on lots of temporary staff and adjunct. If you want more out of people you have to treat them better. "

I suspect the same thing will happen with the 2014 degree.  As new forms of communication sweep across the world, Emerson will be studying them, teaching them, and inventing them.

The Art Book - with the advent of ebooks, physical books will take on a new form and be elevated to the status of art object (think of painting after photography) and there will be a demand for fiction and non fiction books which are stunning works of art as well as literary delivery systems.



The Media in your Brain - virtual reality and AI will make entertainment a more internal action. Games, visual storytelling (film? video? probably not!) and information can be accessed via brain chemistry making a physical screening device unnecessary.  Emerson alumni are on the cutting edge of this technology.



Theater of the Streets - as our society becomes more polarized between the haves and have nots, expect to see the end of live theater as we know it as it becomes entertainment only for the 1% who can afford to see live theater.  Emerson alumni have recognized this problem and have created the ""Theater of the Streets"" movement.  This movement works with local community leaders to support formal theater productions preformed on the street.  As this movement has been going strong for 10 years, the main goal of the movement was to advocate and agitate for more public funding for classical theater, which has begun to happen, however, the TOS has now established itself as a going concern and many cities, towns, and states across America and indeed the world support this theater experience for all.

I'd reach out to the surrounding schools - Suffolk, Tufts Med, MGH, MIT, etc. to see if there would be interest in creating an email list or online forum or physical meetup of some sort. I'm sure you're already aware of http://widow.meetup.com/cities/us/ma/boston/ and similar support services from the wider community, but if academia doesn't have a group of its own, I think it should.  \\ Great suggestions, thanks!"

Oft-forgotten, always silent. 10/10 would study there again.\\ In addition to the 6th floor study room, the Presidents Room on the third floor is often quieter than other parts of the library. The areas closer to the Library's entrance and service desks are naturally noisier and as a result tend to attract group study and socializing.  Given the tight quarters in the Library, sometimes  these boundaries overlap.  If you want to be far away from the activity, check out the quiet study tables and carrels in the West Stacks,\\ The west stacks of the library are designated quiet areas, so if you want some peace I'd definitely recommend heading there (or the aforementioned 6th floor). The study rooms (especially the ones upstairs) lend themselves to loud meetings since you can close the doors, but you can only fit a maximum of 6 people so for big meetings it's not ideal. People have been keeping the former W&G set a quiet area for the most part so I've seen some people utilizing the white boards for meetings and stuff. I think it would be difficult to label it a social area, however, because having 4 different meetings in there could get chaotic. \\ Just a caveat--at night the west stack ""quiet area"" can be pretty noisy, due to noise from the alley.  \\ but Billy the 6th floor doesn't feel like it's part of the library!!!\\ Emily, do you have any suggestions for what we might add to our 6th floor space to make it feel more like part of the library?"

Since my sophomore year I have struggled to get into required marketing courses due to the high amount of VMAs who are able to minor or double major in various communications studies. 

I also find it unfair that while, as previously mentioned, VMAs can minor in areas in the communications department or at least take classes there, that the reverse is not possible. 

I came here to study entertainment marketing. If that is a focus you can take, wouldn't it be beneficial for people like me to be able to take some VMA classes or be able to minor there? 

I have nothing against the VMA department, if anything I would like to be more involved, but lets stop trying to pretend that COMMUNICATIONS (listed first in our slogan) and the ARTS are treated equally here. 

","I've always been a little bitter about the VMA department monopolizing things in general. The major/minor thing not going both ways is something that bothered me even as a WLP major. \\ As a VMA professor, I would love to have more non-majors. I teach in the Institute so that I can have that opportunity. Maybe we could have other VMA minors besides Art History & Photography. What minor in VMA would you want?\\ Also just as a clarifying point VMA majors can not double major, unlike some other majors at Emerson.\\ But they can minor in Comm fields while Comm majors cannot minor in VMA concentrations right? \\ I completly agree!

The variety of backgrounds, experience, and knowledge that a diverse population brings to this institution expands our breadth of knowledge and again makes us a leader among our peer institutions.",

I think the best thing for the College to do is get out of her way!  She is a woman going places and if there are any barriers (credit transfers, paperwork, advisers, etc) in her way those obstacles should be removed.",,
9518,"The institution I came from before I arrived at Emerson was very insular and resistant to change.  When I got to Emerson it was a breath of fresh air until I realized how departmentalized we were at the time.  Over time this has changed dramatically.  I now have more opportunities to collaborate across the college in so many ways that there are almost too many options!  I have been able to stick my neck out on some issues but not so far as to lose it in the end.  Sometimes you need to pick your battles and find out what is the most important thing for you to accomplish during your time here.



I think the thing that has had the most impact on me has been the realization that history really does repeat itself.  In my time here I have gotten to know Emerson's history more intimately than most and there are so many parallels to be drawn and similarities that run in 20-25 year cycles.  It is just fascinating to watch the events unfold.",,Really! That sounds interesting - what are some of the challenges we are facing now that are similar to past ones?
9518,Almost every day,"I am regularly collaborating with other departments within Emerson as well as collaborating with outside colleagues and institutions.  Rarely a day goes by that I am not working with a staff or faculty member to work on a project.

9518,"At Emerson, we tend to be siloed because of the vertical nature of our offices and spaces.  When I attended the Managing for Excellence Cohort in the spring the interaction between myself and my fellow managers took on a whole new meaning.  During the course of business we often just send an email and without a face sometimes we forget that there is a person behind those messages.  By connecting with my peers on a more personal level I, as well as my peers, developed a greater respect for each other and improved working relationships.  Emerson needs to have more opportunities for staff and faculty to interact outside of the normal day to day flurry of emails.",,I absolutely agree Christina! That would be great!

9518,,"Maybe someone already addressed this at some point but I know one of the concerns that has come up in this game is that Emersonians seem to always be ""too busy"" or ""stressed out.""  There have been mentions of the usual lack of staff, resources, etc. that we all gripe about but when I look around there seem to be so many areas where just a little bit more efficiency would go a long way in cutting costs.  For example, I may be flying around trying to get 50 things done while I see someone sitting at a desk anywhere on campus playing Candy Crush, texting, or too busy on Facebook to say hi.  Can we put these people to work? Also, there have been initiatives and other expenses where it seems no one really thought things through or rushed to implement without considering the strain on our already thin resources.  Rather than add more stuff to our already full plates can we take a look at what we have and see how we can make it work better for us?","Having too much to do is part of the problem at Emerson, being burned out is a corollary. The behaviors irritating you sound a lot like burnout to me. Most of us need to get a certain amount done before we can return to our real lives, where our talents, intelligence, and energy are also in demand. Candy Crush and Facebook and stuff is a means of recharging our batteries as much as an issue of wasting work-time. \\ sure, every once and a while but if everytime I come to an office and the person at the front desk is always playing solitaire, texting, etc. then that isn't recharging batteries, that's someone that could be doing something else while sitting at the desk.\\ I KNOW.  It's an addiction, really.  The school should do something about it--provide educational programs, or something.  It's an incredible time suck, and if the person is supposed to be working, it's really not cool.\\ also, it's not even about time management, it's about work/service ethic!!!! \\ The busy-ness and level of multitasking that I see is exhausting.  I see staff burnt out by it, and I see students with stress-related illnesses due to the frantic pace.  



What can be done to influence EC's culture so that for staff, work is spread more evenly between us, and for students, increased value is placed on simply BEING, rather than producing, competing, DOING?



ECAPS has groups that support this, but how can we enlarge our thinking about what's a valuable use of time?\\ Thanks Diane, I agree completely.  yesterday there was discussion about how the turnover here hasn't slowed down (usually there is turn over with a new administration but after two years things start to settle).  I wonder if some of the turnover isn't due to burn out.  It seems very likely."
